#### [Provide the Java client&#x27;s interfaces for migrating a process instance](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15161)

Previously, users of the Java client were unable to migrate process instances using the API. 
The Java client lacked comprehensive interfaces to facilitate process instance migration.
We have introduced distinct interfaces for the Java client, though their full implementation is yet to be completed. 
Users of the Java client can now commence development using these interfaces, enhancing their productivity and efficiency.
#### [Support migrating a process instance from the Java client](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14921)

Previously, users of the Java client were unable to migrate process instances through the API. This resulted in reduced flexibility and control over process management.
This issue arose because the Java client&#x27;s interfaces were not implemented to support the migration of a process instance. The design lacked the option of reusing a migration plan for migrating multiple processes.
The interfaces for the Java client were updated and implemented to support process instance migration. A feature was added to allow the reuse of a migration plan for migrating multiple process instances.
Now, users of the Java client can easily migrate process instances through the API using a reusable migration plan. This additional feature enhances flexibility and control in process management.

#### [Java client supports multi-tenancy for BroadcastSignal RPC](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13558)

In the past, when users attempted to broadcast tenant-aware signals in Zeebe via the Java client&#x27;s &#x60;BroadcastSignalCommand&#x60;, the system could encounter errors. If a user attempted to broadcast a signal for an unauthorized tenant, or if the provided tenant-id was either missing, invalid, or not allowed due to disabled multi-tenancy, the system returned errors such as PERMISSION_DENIED or INVALID_ARGUMENT.
The errors were caused due to the lack of multi-tenancy support in the &#x60;BroadcastSignalCommand&#x60;. This meant that user actions involving tenant authorization or identification could lead to system errors because the system wasn&#x27;t equipped to correctly process multi-tenant identities.
The issue was resolved by augmenting the &#x60;BroadcastSignalCommand&#x60; with a multi-tenancy feature. This fix included exposing an optional &#x60;tenantId&#x60; property/method, which facilitated the system&#x27;s ability to handle actions involving multiple tenants.
With the enhanced &#x60;BroadcastSignalCommand&#x60;, users can now reliably broadcast tenant-aware signals via the Java client without running into issues. The system is equipped to handle cases of unauthorized broadcast attempts, missing or invalid tenant-id inputs, and properly discerns whether multi-tenancy is enabled or disabled.

### Zeebe > Java Client > Bug Fixes
#### [ActivateJobsCommandImpl throws NullPointerException when ZeebeClientProperties.getDefaultJobWorkerName is null](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14176)

Users that created an implementation of the &#x60;ZeebeClientProperties&#x60; returning &#x60;null&#x60; for the &#x60;getDefaultJobWorkerName&#x60; experienced a &#x60;NullPointerException&#x60;. This was due to the constructor of &#x60;ActivateJobsCommandImpl&#x60; attempting to set a &#x60;workerName&#x60; during construction, even if it was null.
The issue arose from the constructor not having the ability to handle null values. This null value handling was expected from the builder pattern used previously, which allowed clients to set &#x60;workerName&#x60; after constructing the command. Furthermore, this issue was inadvertently introduced during a transition from request to command builder.
The system was amended to allow the builder to fallback to the default worker name only if it wasn&#x27;t set by a client during the final command construction. This methodology sidestepped forcing a non-null value set during the constructor phase of the &#x60;ActivateJobsCommandImpl&#x60;.
Now, users can develop implementations of &#x60;ZeebeClientProperties&#x60; that return &#x60;null&#x60; for &#x60;getDefaultJobWorkerName&#x60; without fear of causing a &#x60;NullPointerException&#x60;. This is because the constructor of &#x60;ActivateJobsCommandImpl&#x60; now effectively handles null values.

## Zeebe > Go Client
### Zeebe > Go Client > Enhancements
#### [Go client commands allow specifying a &#x60;tenantId&#x60; / &#x60;tenantIds&#x60; property](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15153)

 Previously, users of the Zeebe Go client couldn&#x27;t specify a &#x60;tenantId&#x60; or &#x60;tenantIds&#x60; property. This limitation made it impossible to use the client in multi-tenant environments. 
 Multi-tenancy support was overlooked when engineering the commands &#x60;DeployResource&#x60;, &#x60;CreateProcessInstance&#x60;, &#x60;PublishMessage&#x60;, &#x60;BroadcastSignal&#x60;, &#x60;EvaluateDecision&#x60;, and &#x60;ActivateJobs&#x60; in the Zeebe Go client software.
 Extended the Zeebe Go client&#x27;s command specifications to include &#x60;tenantId&#x60; and &#x60;tenantIds&#x60; as properties. The following methods were added to support the addition of &#x60;tenantId&#x60;: &#x60;DeployResource&#x60;, &#x60;CreateProcessInstance&#x60;, &#x60;PublishMessage&#x60;, &#x60;BroadcastSignal&#x60;, &#x60;EvaluateDecision&#x60; and for multiple &#x60;tenantIds&#x60;, the &#x60;ActivateJobs&#x60; method.
 Now, Zeebe Go client users are able to specify a &#x60;tenantId&#x60; and &#x60;tenantIds&#x60; in their commands. This allows for seamless operation in multi-tenant environments.
#### [Add multi-tenancy support in the Zeebe Go client](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14477)

Users of the Zeebe Go client were unable to implement multi-tenancy in past iterations, limiting their capacity to segregate access to resources among multiple users.
The Zeebe Go client was initially not engineered to support multi-tenancy, a feature which facilitates resource sharing among different users on a single instance.
The implementation of multi-tenancy in the Zeebe Go client was begun but was eventually de-prioritized and not completed. The initial changes were tracked in PR #14946 but were not finalized.
The Zeebe Go client currently does not support multi-tenancy. The feature remains in the backlog and its implementation is uncertain at this time. Users should continue to operate without the multi-tenancy feature.

#### [go-client: Job worker polling backoff mechanism](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/6150)

 In the past, the Go client lacked a backoff mechanism. In the event of an error received from the gateway by the job poller, the worker would continue to poll for available jobs without any delay.
 The Go client was not initially designed with a backoff feature, unlike the Java client, which responds to any error during the job polling with a delay before next poll. The lack of this feature increased the potential for server-overload, as the client would repeatedly attempt to poll for jobs in the face of sustained networking errors. 
 The Go client has been updated to include the same backoff mechanism as found in the Java client. This includes a default exponential backoff, optional configurability, and the ability for users to provide their own backoff strategy. The backoff kicks in upon encountering errors during the poll for available jobs.
 The Go client now experiences a delay in subsequent job polling attempts whenever an error is received from the gateway. This backoff feature helps avoid server overload and provides users with more control over the backoff strategy. The polling process is now more resilient to sustained networking errors.

### Zeebe > Misc > Enhancements
#### [Process instance migration supports multi-tenancy](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15675)

Previously, the process instance migration command did not support multi-tenancy, allowing commands unauthorized for certain tenants to possibly manipulate process instances.
The oversight was due to lack of propriety control in the initial process instance migration command implementation, not considering multi-tenant environments.
A validation layer was incorporated to ensure that commands only reached process instances they were authorized to interact with.
Now, if a command attempts to migrate a process instance from a tenant it has no authorization over, the system promptly rejects that command. Therefore, the process migration command supports multi-tenancy effectively.
#### [Revert: Migrate task instances with recreated event subscriptions](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15659)

Users experienced a bug related to event subscription recreation during process instance migrations, as a result of changes introduced in issue #15407.
The mechanism through which task instances were migrated with recreated event subscriptions was technically flawed, leading to the reported issue #15570.
The changes introduced by #15407 were reverted, as a result of combined decision-making within engineering and product management teams.
Event subscription migration is now handled in a broader scope, and timers are no longer reset, resulting in a smoother, bug-free experience for users.
#### [Sync Process Instance Migration gRPC documentation with gateway.proto](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15568)

 Users were seeing inconsistency between the documented error codes in the gRPC API docs and the actual &#x27;gateway.proto&#x27; file for Camunda 8. 
 The gRPC documentation was not synchronized with the &#x27;gateway.proto&#x27; file leading to a mismatch in the explanation of error codes.
 We updated the gRPC documentation to align with the &#x27;gateway.proto&#x27; definitions, thereby ensuring the error code explanations are identical in both places.
 Now, users can refer to either the gRPC API documentation or the &#x27;gateway.proto&#x27; file and get the same explanation for error codes, leading to clearer understanding and troubleshooting.
#### [Migrate task instances with recreated event subscriptions](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15407)

Previously, users faced issues while migrating a process instance due to the presence of event subscriptions in the process instance and the need for event subscriptions in the target process. The migration was difficult as the event subscriptions could exist on partitions outside of the process instance, resulting in the breakdown of the migration process and causing inconvenience for users.
The underlying cause of this problem was due to the distinction between the process instance and the partitions where event subscriptions could reside. This made the migration process of existing event subscriptions challenging.
To resolve this issue, an approach was implemented which involved unsubscribing each active element instance in the process instance and subscribing to new events in the target process for each migrated element instance.
Now, users can successfully migrate process instances even when there are event subscriptions in both the original and target processes, leading to more efficient and seamless transitions.
#### [Configure &#x60;identity-sdk&#x60; through &#x60;identity-spring-boot-starter&#x60; in the Gateway](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15389)

 
Previously, users had to manually add new Identity configuration properties in Zeebe whenever Identity introduced new features, leading to a time-consuming process.
 
This issue stemmed from the Identity configuration properties being coupled with Zeebe configuration settings, causing a lack of automation.
 
Changes were made to the &#x60;IdentityInterceptor&#x60;, &#x60;Gateway&#x60;, &#x60;StandaloneGateway&#x60;, and &#x60;EmbeddedGatewayService&#x60; classes to enable the &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; Spring bean to configure the &#x60;identity-sdk&#x60;. The &#x60;StandaloneBroker&#x60; class now also passes the &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; bean. The &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; test was also adjusted to use &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; bean for Identity configuration.
 
Now, users don&#x27;t need to manually add new Identity configuration properties to Zeebe. The &#x60;identity-spring-boot-starter&#x60; creates an &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; Spring bean to handle these additions automatically. Thus, Zeebe stays in sync with Identity updates without manual intervention.
#### [Add integration test to &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; test](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15382)

 Previously, the &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; integration tests lacked comprehensive coverage, potentially failing to identify some issues.
 The original design of the testing suite did not include certain essential test cases. 
 Additional integration tests were incorporated into the &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; test, implementing similar test cases as found in the same class. The &#x60;shouldCompleteJobForTenant&#x60; test was used as an example. 
 The &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; now provides a more complete testing scenario, enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the system.
#### [Support &#x60;UpdateJobTimeout&#x60; RPC in Go Client](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15366)

Previously, the Go Client did not support the &#x60;UpdateJobTimeout&#x60; RPC, limiting the user&#x27;s control over job execution times. 
The omission occurred since this functionality was not initially incorporated into the Go Client&#x27;s suite of features.
The &#x60;UpdateJobTimeout&#x60; RPC function was added to the Go Client, mirroring the functionality found in the Job Update Retries command.
Users now have the ability to control job update timeouts directly from the Go Client, allowing for greater control over job execution and management.
#### [Update &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60; files in order to allow user to disable form exporting](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15193)

Users were unable to disable form exporting when using &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60;.
The options within these template files were not designed to allow users to disable form exporting.
We updated &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60; to include an option for disabling form exporting. 
Users can now disable form exporting when working with &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60;.
#### [Export compensation subscription events](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15140)

 Previously, BPMN compensation events were lacking an associated compensation record, making it impossible for these events to be exported to Elasticsearch and OpenSearch.
 This was caused by an oversight in the initial implementation of the process as the functionality for exporting these records was not taken into consideration.
 To rectify this, we adhered to the development guide and created a new compensation record for BPMN compensation events. This enhancement was implemented via the pull request https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15392.
 It&#x27;s now possible for BPMN compensation events to be exported to Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, thereby improving the system&#x27;s traceability and debugging capabilities.
#### [I can execute a process with a compensation end event](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14967)

 Users were able to deploy a process with a compensation end event, but attempting to execute the process did not invoke the compensation handlers. Despite the successful completion of the process instances that contained a compensation end event, the compensation end event would activate and complete without properly recording the event type as &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60;. 
 The system was originally designed to ignore the invocation of compensation handlers during the process execution, effectively lacking the feature to handle compensation events properly.
 Refined the process execution regulation to engage with compensation handlers. The system was updated to allow for successful completion of process instances that contained compensation end events while activating and interacting with the associated compensation handlers.
 Now, when a process with a compensation end event is executed, the compensation handlers are activated and the event is accurately logged as a &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type. The process instance can complete successfully, and every action is appropriately recorded.
#### [The record for a compensation event has the correct event type](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14944)

 Compensation events in the execution of a BPMN process were not accurately represented. These events were not properly labeled with a dedicated event type, resulting in an ambiguous or inaccurate record of the event types in the &#x60;ProcessInstance&#x60;.
 In the past, the field &#x60;bpmnEventType&#x60; did not include a &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; type. Hence, events related to BPMN compensation such as compensation intermediate throwing events, compensation end events, compensation boundary events, and compensation start events were all missing the required &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type.
 We introduced a new &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type in &#x60;BpmnEventType.java&#x60; to reflect the execution of compensation events accurately in the BPMN process. 
 Now, all events related to a BPMN compensation event are accurately tagged with the &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type. As a result, the record for a compensation event now has the correct event type, which allows for a more accurate record-keeping and understanding of the process instance.
#### [I can deploy a process with BPMN compensation event subprocesses](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14943)

 
Users were unable to deploy a process with BPMN compensation event subprocesses due to the existing validation rules.
 
The issue arose from validation rules that did not allow compensation start events within event subprocesses. 
 
The validation rules were adjusted to permit compensation start events within event subprocesses. Additionally, restrictions were set in place to ensure a compensation start event is within an event subprocess and a compensation event subprocess is inside an embedded subprocess. Processes at the top level were not permitted to host the event subprocess.
 
Users can now deploy a process with BPMN compensation event subprocesses aligning with the updated validation rules and the designated restrictions. The issue of being unable to deploy processes with these specific subprocesses has been resolved.
#### [I can deploy a process with BPMN compensation events](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14942)

 Users were unable to deploy a process with BPMN compensation events due to the validation rules that were in place. 
 The system&#x27;s validation rules were not designed to allow the inclusion of specific BPMN elements such as Compensation intermediate throwing event, Compensation end event, Compensation boundary event, and Activity with compensation marker. 
 The validation rules were adjusted to allow the aforementioned BPMN elements. Enhanced restrictions were also put into place to maintain a secure and effective deployment process. 
 Users are now able to deploy a process that includes BPMN compensation events, with the system ensuring a safe and reliable process.
#### [I can model a process with compensation events via BPMN model API](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14939)

 Users previously found creating a process via builder with compensation events via BPMN model API to be verbose and clunky. They found it difficult to create test cases for compensation events due to the unintuitive process.
 The existing BPMN model API&#x27;s structure for handling compensation events lacked clarity and efficiency. This was highlighted in the complicated Java code necessary for a simple compensation process.
 We have revised and streamlined the builder, making it more user-friendly and efficient. The codes have been simplified to enable easier creation of test cases for compensation events. 
 When creating a process with compensation events through the builder in the BPMN model API, users now have a smoother and more intuitive experience. The simplified process now enables easier and more efficient generation of test cases.
#### [Add support to Java client for Form deletion](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14858)

Users were unable to delete Forms using the Java client. 
The functionality for Form deletion was not implemented in the Java client&#x27;s code. 
The necessary code was added to the Java client to enable Form deletion. 
Users can now delete Forms directly through the Java client.
#### [Replace Dependabot with Renovate](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14701)

 The project had Dependabot and Renovate both operating in the repository, which brought about redundancy and Dependabot failed to cover all use cases. This inefficient setup caused extra load and confusion.
 The project was configured to use both Dependabot and Renovate for dependency updates. While Dependabot was managing the update for maven and docker, Renovate was solely managing all other dependencies.
 The functionality of Dependabot was shifted to Renovate by altering the renovate.json to also look after the maven and docker updates. A pull request was filed and merged to remove the Dependabot tool.
 Now, the project uses only Renovate for dependency updates. This streamlined approach reduces redundancy and enhances efficiency. Further PRs will validate the change. The titles and commit messages from Renovate were corrected for clarity. The removal of Dependabot related Github actions is pending.
#### [Use caching for Forms](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14562)

Users experienced slow performance during forms retrieval, because the system was not using any caching mechanism for recently retrieved forms. 
The underlying issue was the absence of a caching mechanism in the DbFormState. This situation arose when forms were introduced to Zeebe in 8.3 without incorporating a cache system for performance enhancement. 
A caching mechanism was implemented to DbFormState, using a similar process to that applied to Decision and Process states.
Forms retrieval is now faster due to the application of a caching mechanism for recently accessed forms. Users should observe more efficient data retrieval and improved performance.
#### [Support multi-tenancy for Resource Deletion](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14279)

 Previously, the process of resource deletion was not accommodating multi-tenancy. That made the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; incapable of looking up resources using authorized tenant IDs, causing a limitation in the system functioning in tenant-aware environments.
 The issue occurred due to the absence of a multi-tenant capability in the design of the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; functionality. This resulted in it not being capable of identifying resources connected with distinct tenant IDs.
 Changes were made to allow the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; to lookup resources using authorized tenant IDs. In addition, unit tests and QA tests were added specifically for tenant-aware resource deletion. The previously inactive tests in the engine&#x27;s &#x60;TenantAwareTimerStartEventTest&#x60; were re-enabled to support this enhancement.
 Now, the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; successfully recognises and handles resources associated with various tenants. This denotes that the system can function proficiently in multi-tenant scenarios, thereby offering improved performance and versatility. Various tests are also now active, ensuring consistent system integrity in multi-tenant environments.
#### [Support deletion of the Forms through DeleteResource gRPC](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14272)

Previously, users were unable to delete Forms using DeleteResource gRPC method.
This issue was due to the lack of support for Forms resource deletion in the DeleteResource gRPC.
Developers extended the DeleteResource gRPC method to handle Form resource deletion.
Users can now delete Forms via DeleteResource gRPC, offering a more flexible management of Forms.

#### [Keep track of event types in the Engine](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13433)

Users were previously unable to keep track of event types that triggered elements in Grafana, as these event types were not added to the job metric in the Engine.
The &#x60;ProcessEngineMetrics&#x60; class did not have a method for event types for &#x60;element_instance_events_total&#x60; metric, resulting in a lack of detailed information for activated, completed, and terminated element instances in Grafana. 
The &#x60;ProcessEngineMetrics&#x60; class was updated to include event type indicators for activated, completed, and terminated element instances in the &#x60;element_instance_events_total&#x60; metric. An additional label was also added to this metric to track the &#x60;eventType&#x60;.
Users can now directly monitor event types that trigger specific elements in Grafana, providing more concise and detailed system insights.
#### [Indicate the type of activated/completed/terminated catch events in Grafana](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13410)

 Previously, users reported that the Engine was lagging behind while processing new records. It was hard to identify the type of catch events causing the issue, so the problem was difficult to troubleshoot in Grafana without resorting to additional log resources.
 The incident was caused by a timer catch event that was generating multiple new records, overloading the thread pool. As a result, the specific type of catch event that was contributing to the lag wasn&#x27;t identifiable in Grafana&#x27;s &#x27;General Overview -&gt; Current Events&#x27; view. 
 We added the type of catch events to Grafana&#x27;s &#x27;General Overview -&gt; Current Events&#x27; view. Now, every element instance contains its own type. 
 Users can now differentiate between types of catch events directly in the Grafana view. This feature aids users in identifying problem sources quickly and simplifies troubleshooting.
#### [Process instance migration supports multi-tenancy](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15675)

Previously, the process instance migration command did not support multi-tenancy, allowing commands unauthorized for certain tenants to possibly manipulate process instances.
The oversight was due to lack of propriety control in the initial process instance migration command implementation, not considering multi-tenant environments.
A validation layer was incorporated to ensure that commands only reached process instances they were authorized to interact with.
Now, if a command attempts to migrate a process instance from a tenant it has no authorization over, the system promptly rejects that command. Therefore, the process migration command supports multi-tenancy effectively.
#### [Revert: Migrate task instances with recreated event subscriptions](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15659)

Users experienced a bug related to event subscription recreation during process instance migrations, as a result of changes introduced in issue #15407.
The mechanism through which task instances were migrated with recreated event subscriptions was technically flawed, leading to the reported issue #15570.
The changes introduced by #15407 were reverted, as a result of combined decision-making within engineering and product management teams.
Event subscription migration is now handled in a broader scope, and timers are no longer reset, resulting in a smoother, bug-free experience for users.
#### [Sync Process Instance Migration gRPC documentation with gateway.proto](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15568)

 Users were seeing inconsistency between the documented error codes in the gRPC API docs and the actual &#x27;gateway.proto&#x27; file for Camunda 8. 
 The gRPC documentation was not synchronized with the &#x27;gateway.proto&#x27; file leading to a mismatch in the explanation of error codes.
 We updated the gRPC documentation to align with the &#x27;gateway.proto&#x27; definitions, thereby ensuring the error code explanations are identical in both places.
 Now, users can refer to either the gRPC API documentation or the &#x27;gateway.proto&#x27; file and get the same explanation for error codes, leading to clearer understanding and troubleshooting.
#### [Migrate task instances with recreated event subscriptions](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15407)

Previously, users faced issues while migrating a process instance due to the presence of event subscriptions in the process instance and the need for event subscriptions in the target process. The migration was difficult as the event subscriptions could exist on partitions outside of the process instance, resulting in the breakdown of the migration process and causing inconvenience for users.
The underlying cause of this problem was due to the distinction between the process instance and the partitions where event subscriptions could reside. This made the migration process of existing event subscriptions challenging.
To resolve this issue, an approach was implemented which involved unsubscribing each active element instance in the process instance and subscribing to new events in the target process for each migrated element instance.
Now, users can successfully migrate process instances even when there are event subscriptions in both the original and target processes, leading to more efficient and seamless transitions.
#### [Allow setting &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter for OAuth2 authentication](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15391)

 Users were unable to set the &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter for OAuth2 authentication when using the Zeebe Java client with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and generic OpenID Connect.
 The Zeebe Java client did not provide support for setting the &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter in the token request, a requirement for compatibility with certain authentication protocols.
 The Zeebe Java client was enhanced to support setting the &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter in the token request. This was implemented by modifying the &#x60;OAuthCredentialsProvider.java&#x60; file and integrating the additional parameter into &#x60;spring-zeebe&#x60;, which is used by Connectors.
 Users can now set the &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter for OAuth2 authentication with the Zeebe Java client, enabling the use of Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and generic OpenID Connect.
#### [Configure &#x60;identity-sdk&#x60; through &#x60;identity-spring-boot-starter&#x60; in the Gateway](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15389)

 
Previously, users had to manually add new Identity configuration properties in Zeebe whenever Identity introduced new features, leading to a time-consuming process.
 
This issue stemmed from the Identity configuration properties being coupled with Zeebe configuration settings, causing a lack of automation.
 
Changes were made to the &#x60;IdentityInterceptor&#x60;, &#x60;Gateway&#x60;, &#x60;StandaloneGateway&#x60;, and &#x60;EmbeddedGatewayService&#x60; classes to enable the &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; Spring bean to configure the &#x60;identity-sdk&#x60;. The &#x60;StandaloneBroker&#x60; class now also passes the &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; bean. The &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; test was also adjusted to use &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; bean for Identity configuration.
 
Now, users don&#x27;t need to manually add new Identity configuration properties to Zeebe. The &#x60;identity-spring-boot-starter&#x60; creates an &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; Spring bean to handle these additions automatically. Thus, Zeebe stays in sync with Identity updates without manual intervention.
#### [Add integration test to &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; test](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15382)

 Previously, the &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; integration tests lacked comprehensive coverage, potentially failing to identify some issues.
 The original design of the testing suite did not include certain essential test cases. 
 Additional integration tests were incorporated into the &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; test, implementing similar test cases as found in the same class. The &#x60;shouldCompleteJobForTenant&#x60; test was used as an example. 
 The &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; now provides a more complete testing scenario, enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the system.
#### [Support &#x60;UpdateJobTimeout&#x60; RPC in Go Client](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15366)

Previously, the Go Client did not support the &#x60;UpdateJobTimeout&#x60; RPC, limiting the user&#x27;s control over job execution times. 
The omission occurred since this functionality was not initially incorporated into the Go Client&#x27;s suite of features.
The &#x60;UpdateJobTimeout&#x60; RPC function was added to the Go Client, mirroring the functionality found in the Job Update Retries command.
Users now have the ability to control job update timeouts directly from the Go Client, allowing for greater control over job execution and management.
#### [Support ElasticSearch 8.9+](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15306)

 Users were unable to upgrade their ElasticSearch instances to 8.9+ due to lack of support from the Zeebe&#x27;s ElasticSearch dependencies.
  
 The issue was caused as ElasticSearch was frequently updating its minor versions with important bug-fixes and patches. Zeebe&#x27;s dependencies, however, did not align with these upgrades which led to issues when users tried upgrading their ElasticSearch instances to 8.9 or higher.
 The dependencies of Zeebe&#x27;s ElasticSearch were updated to version 8.9+. In addition, the zeebe-analytics dependency was also updated and tests were ensured to run successfully.
 Users can now upgrade their ElasticSearch instances to 8.9+ without any issues as Zeebe&#x27;s dependencies support these versions. The operation of all components is now aligned with ElasticSearch 8.9.
#### [Update &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60; files in order to allow user to disable form exporting](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15193)

Users were unable to disable form exporting when using &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60;.
The options within these template files were not designed to allow users to disable form exporting.
We updated &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60; to include an option for disabling form exporting. 
Users can now disable form exporting when working with &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60;.
#### [Export compensation subscription events](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15140)

 Previously, BPMN compensation events were lacking an associated compensation record, making it impossible for these events to be exported to Elasticsearch and OpenSearch.
 This was caused by an oversight in the initial implementation of the process as the functionality for exporting these records was not taken into consideration.
 To rectify this, we adhered to the development guide and created a new compensation record for BPMN compensation events. This enhancement was implemented via the pull request https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15392.
 It&#x27;s now possible for BPMN compensation events to be exported to Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, thereby improving the system&#x27;s traceability and debugging capabilities.
#### [Migrate task instances with variables](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15114)

Users were unable to migrate task instances with variables in the past due to insufficient implementation.
The system was inadequately configured, lacking a necessary &#x60;VariableIntent&#x60; labeled &#x60;MIGRATED&#x60; to handle such variable changes during process instance migration. Discrepancies such as the absence of &#x60;elementId&#x60; field in variables and inconsistencies in &#x60;scopeKey&#x60; management compounded the issue.
We introduced a new &#x60;VariableIntent&#x60; called &#x60;MIGRATED&#x60;. Events were then applied to update related BPMN properties. Within the &#x60;ProcessInstanceMigration&#x60; command processor, &#x60;Variable:MIGRATED&#x60; events were appended for each variable of a process instance. This selection also included child element instances. To minimize record overload, variable&#x27;s &#x60;value&#x60; was cleared during appending events. &#x60;elementId&#x60; field, a known discrepancy previously, was removed from the list.
With these changes, users can now successfully migrate task instances with variables. The system upholds the variable scope&#x27;s integrity and refreshes variables effectively while avoiding excessive data burden. Variables now remain constant, unless changes in Sub Process hierarchies necessitate movement.
#### [Migrate service task instances (including jobs)](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15113)

 
Earlier, users were unable to migrate service task instances, including jobs effectively. 
 
The product lacked a &#x60;JobIntent&#x60; &#x60;MIGRATED&#x60; and an event applier that would have updated necessary properties of a job during migration. Additionally, &#x60;ProcessInstanceMigration&#x60; command processor was missing the ability to append &#x60;ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED&#x60; and &#x60;Job:MIGRATED&#x60; events for every child instance during the migration process. 
 
We&#x27;ve added a &#x60;JobIntent&#x60; &#x60;MIGRATED&#x60; and also introduced an event applier that updates properties such as &#x60;bpmnProcessId&#x60;, &#x60;processDefinitionVersion&#x60;, &#x60;processDefinitionKey&#x60;, and &#x60;elementId&#x60;. In the &#x60;ProcessInstanceMigration&#x60; command processor, we&#x27;ve added the functionality for various child instances to append &#x60;ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED&#x60; event and for &#x60;SERVICE_TASK&#x60; type child to append &#x60;Job:MIGRATED&#x60; event. 
 
Now, users are able to successfully migrate service task instances and jobs. Additionally, it&#x27;s possible to use all job commands like activate, fail, throwError, yield, complete, etc. during the process migration.

#### [Introduce new compensation subscription record](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15063)

The system previously lacked a method of effectively tracking completed activities with compensation handlers, causing inefficiencies and potential inconsistencies. 
The absence of a specific record for compensation events was the root cause. This omission made it challenging to keep track of the compensation handler&#x27;s state and made it difficult to identify the compensation throw event that triggered a compensation handler.
A new record was introduced for compensation events. It is designed to track completed activities with compensation handlers and monitor the state of the compensation handlers. This record is equipped to manage the lifecycle of the compensation, which includes states like &#x27;CREATED&#x27;, &#x27;TRIGGERED&#x27;, &#x27;COMPLETED&#x27;, and &#x27;DELETED&#x27;. 
With the implementation of the new compensation record, the system now effectively tracks and manages activities with compensation handlers. It can also efficiently identify the compensation throw event responsible for triggering a compensation handler. The process of keeping track of the state of compensation handlers is now more streamlined, enhancing the overall performance of the system.
#### [Add Job Update Timeout intents](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15034)

The system was unable to adjust the timeouts for jobs once they had been set, leaving users without the ability to extend or shorten the allotted time for jobs according to project requirements. 
The job handling system lacked the &#x60;UPDATE_TIMEOUT&#x60; intent. Therefore, it couldn&#x27;t locate the job in the state or its deadline. Also, the system was not designed to update the &#x60;JOB_DEADLINES&#x60; ColumnFamily because of the fixed key it used. 
Added the &#x60;UPDATE_TIMEOUT&#x60; intent to the &#x60;JobIntent&#x60; class which looks through the state for the needed job and its deadline. If found, it writes the &#x60;TIMEOUT_UPDATED&#x60; event, effectively changing the deadline in the state. Additionally, adjusted the behavior of &#x60;TIMEOUT_UPDATED&#x60; event to allow modifications in the &#x60;JOB_DEADLINES&#x60; ColumnFamily, implementing a removal of the existing entry for the job and insertion of a new value.
Users can now manage the duration of jobs by updating their timeouts. The system correctly finds the job and its current deadline and applies the requested changes, giving users greater control over their workflows.
#### [I can execute a process with a compensation end event](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14967)

 Users were able to deploy a process with a compensation end event, but attempting to execute the process did not invoke the compensation handlers. Despite the successful completion of the process instances that contained a compensation end event, the compensation end event would activate and complete without properly recording the event type as &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60;. 
 The system was originally designed to ignore the invocation of compensation handlers during the process execution, effectively lacking the feature to handle compensation events properly.
 Refined the process execution regulation to engage with compensation handlers. The system was updated to allow for successful completion of process instances that contained compensation end events while activating and interacting with the associated compensation handlers.
 Now, when a process with a compensation end event is executed, the compensation handlers are activated and the event is accurately logged as a &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type. The process instance can complete successfully, and every action is appropriately recorded.
#### [I can execute a process with an intermediate compensation throw event](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14965)

 Previously, users were unable to execute a process that included an intermediate compensation throw event. While deployment of such a process was possible, attempts at execution were unsuccessful.
 The underlying issue was a lack of support for the invocation of compensation handlers during the execution of a process with a compensation intermediate throw event.
 We implemented a mechanism to activate and complete a compensation intermediate throw event within the process instance. We also added the event type &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; to the records for the compensation intermediate throw event.
 Now, users can successfully execute a process that includes a compensation intermediate throw event. The event activates and completes as expected, allowing the full process instance to be completed. Additionally, the related event records correctly reflect the &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type.

#### [The record for a compensation event has the correct event type](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14944)

 Compensation events in the execution of a BPMN process were not accurately represented. These events were not properly labeled with a dedicated event type, resulting in an ambiguous or inaccurate record of the event types in the &#x60;ProcessInstance&#x60;.
 In the past, the field &#x60;bpmnEventType&#x60; did not include a &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; type. Hence, events related to BPMN compensation such as compensation intermediate throwing events, compensation end events, compensation boundary events, and compensation start events were all missing the required &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type.
 We introduced a new &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type in &#x60;BpmnEventType.java&#x60; to reflect the execution of compensation events accurately in the BPMN process. 
 Now, all events related to a BPMN compensation event are accurately tagged with the &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type. As a result, the record for a compensation event now has the correct event type, which allows for a more accurate record-keeping and understanding of the process instance.
#### [I can deploy a process with BPMN compensation event subprocesses](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14943)

 
Users were unable to deploy a process with BPMN compensation event subprocesses due to the existing validation rules.
 
The issue arose from validation rules that did not allow compensation start events within event subprocesses. 
 
The validation rules were adjusted to permit compensation start events within event subprocesses. Additionally, restrictions were set in place to ensure a compensation start event is within an event subprocess and a compensation event subprocess is inside an embedded subprocess. Processes at the top level were not permitted to host the event subprocess.
 
Users can now deploy a process with BPMN compensation event subprocesses aligning with the updated validation rules and the designated restrictions. The issue of being unable to deploy processes with these specific subprocesses has been resolved.
#### [I can deploy a process with BPMN compensation events](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14942)

 Users were unable to deploy a process with BPMN compensation events due to the validation rules that were in place. 
 The system&#x27;s validation rules were not designed to allow the inclusion of specific BPMN elements such as Compensation intermediate throwing event, Compensation end event, Compensation boundary event, and Activity with compensation marker. 
 The validation rules were adjusted to allow the aforementioned BPMN elements. Enhanced restrictions were also put into place to maintain a secure and effective deployment process. 
 Users are now able to deploy a process that includes BPMN compensation events, with the system ensuring a safe and reliable process.
#### [I can model a process with compensation events via BPMN model API](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14939)

#### [Add support to Java client for Form deletion](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14858)

Users were unable to delete Forms using the Java client. 
The functionality for Form deletion was not implemented in the Java client&#x27;s code. 
The necessary code was added to the Java client to enable Form deletion. 
Users can now delete Forms directly through the Java client.
#### [Replace Dependabot with Renovate](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14701)

#### [Support general-usage tenant-providing interceptor for SM](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14285)


Previously, users of Zeebe 8.3.0 could only support multi-tenancy over Identity and could not use their own tenant provider.
This issue was a result of the lack of a feature in Zeebe to allow users to implement their own custom interceptors to provide tenant information.
We expanded the &#x60;InterceptorUtil&#x60; class to provide the &#x60;AUTHORIZED_TENANTS_KEY&#x60; gRPC context key, which helps users implement their own tenant-providing logic. We also updated the process of handling &#x60;tenantId&#x60; data to respect whether multi-tenancy is enabled or not.
Now, users have greater flexibility in supporting multi-tenancy. The system will only use data provided by the &#x60;AUTHORIZED_TENANTS_KEY&#x60; gRPC Context key if multi-tenancy is enabled. Users can implement their &#x27;tenant-providing&#x27; interceptor as they see fit, adding greater adaptability to specific needs and use-cases.
#### [Support multi-tenancy for Resource Deletion](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14279)

 Previously, the process of resource deletion was not accommodating multi-tenancy. That made the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; incapable of looking up resources using authorized tenant IDs, causing a limitation in the system functioning in tenant-aware environments.
 The issue occurred due to the absence of a multi-tenant capability in the design of the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; functionality. This resulted in it not being capable of identifying resources connected with distinct tenant IDs.
 Changes were made to allow the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; to lookup resources using authorized tenant IDs. In addition, unit tests and QA tests were added specifically for tenant-aware resource deletion. The previously inactive tests in the engine&#x27;s &#x60;TenantAwareTimerStartEventTest&#x60; were re-enabled to support this enhancement.
 Now, the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; successfully recognises and handles resources associated with various tenants. This denotes that the system can function proficiently in multi-tenant scenarios, thereby offering improved performance and versatility. Various tests are also now active, ensuring consistent system integrity in multi-tenant environments.
#### [Support deletion of the Forms through DeleteResource gRPC](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14272)

Previously, users were unable to delete Forms using DeleteResource gRPC method.
This issue was due to the lack of support for Forms resource deletion in the DeleteResource gRPC.
Developers extended the DeleteResource gRPC method to handle Form resource deletion.
Users can now delete Forms via DeleteResource gRPC, offering a more flexible management of Forms.

#### [Keep track of event types in the Engine](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13433)

Users were previously unable to keep track of event types that triggered elements in Grafana, as these event types were not added to the job metric in the Engine.
The &#x60;ProcessEngineMetrics&#x60; class did not have a method for event types for &#x60;element_instance_events_total&#x60; metric, resulting in a lack of detailed information for activated, completed, and terminated element instances in Grafana. 
The &#x60;ProcessEngineMetrics&#x60; class was updated to include event type indicators for activated, completed, and terminated element instances in the &#x60;element_instance_events_total&#x60; metric. An additional label was also added to this metric to track the &#x60;eventType&#x60;.
Users can now directly monitor event types that trigger specific elements in Grafana, providing more concise and detailed system insights.
#### [Indicate the type of activated/completed/terminated catch events in Grafana](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13410)

 Previously, users reported that the Engine was lagging behind while processing new records. It was hard to identify the type of catch events causing the issue, so the problem was difficult to troubleshoot in Grafana without resorting to additional log resources.
 The incident was caused by a timer catch event that was generating multiple new records, overloading the thread pool. As a result, the specific type of catch event that was contributing to the lag wasn&#x27;t identifiable in Grafana&#x27;s &#x27;General Overview -&gt; Current Events&#x27; view. 
 We added the type of catch events to Grafana&#x27;s &#x27;General Overview -&gt; Current Events&#x27; view. Now, every element instance contains its own type. 
 Users can now differentiate between types of catch events directly in the Grafana view. This feature aids users in identifying problem sources quickly and simplifies troubleshooting.
#### [Zeebe supports multi-tenancy for BPMN signal events](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13336)

 
Before this update, Zeebe did not support multi-tenancy for BPMN signal events. This hampered the ability for different tenants to broadcast their own distinct signals, resulting in a lack of necessary separation and potential confusion when handling multiple processes.
 
The underlying issue was that the &#x60;SignalSubscriptionState&#x60; could not persist the &#x60;tenantId&#x60;, and the engine was unable to process &#x60;SignalRecord&#x60; commands with a tenant ID. This led to a lack of multi-tenancy support in the ProcessingStates used by signal broadcasting.
 
We modified the &#x60;SignalSubscriptionState&#x60; to accommodate the &#x60;tenantId&#x60;, and updated the engine to process &#x60;SignalRecord&#x60; commands with a tenant ID. We also provided multi-tenancy data migration for the ProcessingStates used by signal broadcasting. Further, the Elasticsearch/Opensearch record templates were updated to include a &#x60;tenantId&#x60; property.
 
Zeebe now correctly supports multi-tenancy for BPMN signal events. Each tenant can broadcast their own specific signals, enabling clearer process definition and control across different tenants. The addition of the &#x60;tenantId&#x60; property facilitates identification and streamlines multi-tenant operations.
#### [Allow setting &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter for OAuth2 authentication](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15391)

 Users were unable to set the &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter for OAuth2 authentication when using the Zeebe Java client with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and generic OpenID Connect.
 The Zeebe Java client did not provide support for setting the &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter in the token request, a requirement for compatibility with certain authentication protocols.
 The Zeebe Java client was enhanced to support setting the &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter in the token request. This was implemented by modifying the &#x60;OAuthCredentialsProvider.java&#x60; file and integrating the additional parameter into &#x60;spring-zeebe&#x60;, which is used by Connectors.
 Users can now set the &#x60;scope&#x60; parameter for OAuth2 authentication with the Zeebe Java client, enabling the use of Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and generic OpenID Connect.
#### [Configure &#x60;identity-sdk&#x60; through &#x60;identity-spring-boot-starter&#x60; in the Gateway](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15389)

 
Previously, users had to manually add new Identity configuration properties in Zeebe whenever Identity introduced new features, leading to a time-consuming process.
 
This issue stemmed from the Identity configuration properties being coupled with Zeebe configuration settings, causing a lack of automation.
 
Changes were made to the &#x60;IdentityInterceptor&#x60;, &#x60;Gateway&#x60;, &#x60;StandaloneGateway&#x60;, and &#x60;EmbeddedGatewayService&#x60; classes to enable the &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; Spring bean to configure the &#x60;identity-sdk&#x60;. The &#x60;StandaloneBroker&#x60; class now also passes the &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; bean. The &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; test was also adjusted to use &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; bean for Identity configuration.
 
Now, users don&#x27;t need to manually add new Identity configuration properties to Zeebe. The &#x60;identity-spring-boot-starter&#x60; creates an &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; Spring bean to handle these additions automatically. Thus, Zeebe stays in sync with Identity updates without manual intervention.
#### [Add integration test to &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; test](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15382)

 Previously, the &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; integration tests lacked comprehensive coverage, potentially failing to identify some issues.
 The original design of the testing suite did not include certain essential test cases. 
 Additional integration tests were incorporated into the &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; test, implementing similar test cases as found in the same class. The &#x60;shouldCompleteJobForTenant&#x60; test was used as an example. 
 The &#x60;MultiTenancyOverIdentityIT&#x60; now provides a more complete testing scenario, enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the system.
#### [Support ElasticSearch 8.9+](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15306)

 Users were unable to upgrade their ElasticSearch instances to 8.9+ due to lack of support from the Zeebe&#x27;s ElasticSearch dependencies.
  
 The issue was caused as ElasticSearch was frequently updating its minor versions with important bug-fixes and patches. Zeebe&#x27;s dependencies, however, did not align with these upgrades which led to issues when users tried upgrading their ElasticSearch instances to 8.9 or higher.
 The dependencies of Zeebe&#x27;s ElasticSearch were updated to version 8.9+. In addition, the zeebe-analytics dependency was also updated and tests were ensured to run successfully.
 Users can now upgrade their ElasticSearch instances to 8.9+ without any issues as Zeebe&#x27;s dependencies support these versions. The operation of all components is now aligned with ElasticSearch 8.9.
#### [Update &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60; files in order to allow user to disable form exporting](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15193)

Users were unable to disable form exporting when using &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60;.
The options within these template files were not designed to allow users to disable form exporting.
We updated &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60; to include an option for disabling form exporting. 
Users can now disable form exporting when working with &#x60;broker.yaml.template&#x60; and &#x60;broker.standalone.yaml.template&#x60;.
#### [Export compensation subscription events](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15140)

 Previously, BPMN compensation events were lacking an associated compensation record, making it impossible for these events to be exported to Elasticsearch and OpenSearch.
 This was caused by an oversight in the initial implementation of the process as the functionality for exporting these records was not taken into consideration.
 To rectify this, we adhered to the development guide and created a new compensation record for BPMN compensation events. This enhancement was implemented via the pull request https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15392.
 It&#x27;s now possible for BPMN compensation events to be exported to Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, thereby improving the system&#x27;s traceability and debugging capabilities.
#### [Migrate task instances with variables](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15114)

Users were unable to migrate task instances with variables in the past due to insufficient implementation.
The system was inadequately configured, lacking a necessary &#x60;VariableIntent&#x60; labeled &#x60;MIGRATED&#x60; to handle such variable changes during process instance migration. Discrepancies such as the absence of &#x60;elementId&#x60; field in variables and inconsistencies in &#x60;scopeKey&#x60; management compounded the issue.
We introduced a new &#x60;VariableIntent&#x60; called &#x60;MIGRATED&#x60;. Events were then applied to update related BPMN properties. Within the &#x60;ProcessInstanceMigration&#x60; command processor, &#x60;Variable:MIGRATED&#x60; events were appended for each variable of a process instance. This selection also included child element instances. To minimize record overload, variable&#x27;s &#x60;value&#x60; was cleared during appending events. &#x60;elementId&#x60; field, a known discrepancy previously, was removed from the list.
With these changes, users can now successfully migrate task instances with variables. The system upholds the variable scope&#x27;s integrity and refreshes variables effectively while avoiding excessive data burden. Variables now remain constant, unless changes in Sub Process hierarchies necessitate movement.
#### [Migrate service task instances (including jobs)](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15113)

 
Earlier, users were unable to migrate service task instances, including jobs effectively. 
 
The product lacked a &#x60;JobIntent&#x60; &#x60;MIGRATED&#x60; and an event applier that would have updated necessary properties of a job during migration. Additionally, &#x60;ProcessInstanceMigration&#x60; command processor was missing the ability to append &#x60;ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED&#x60; and &#x60;Job:MIGRATED&#x60; events for every child instance during the migration process. 
 
We&#x27;ve added a &#x60;JobIntent&#x60; &#x60;MIGRATED&#x60; and also introduced an event applier that updates properties such as &#x60;bpmnProcessId&#x60;, &#x60;processDefinitionVersion&#x60;, &#x60;processDefinitionKey&#x60;, and &#x60;elementId&#x60;. In the &#x60;ProcessInstanceMigration&#x60; command processor, we&#x27;ve added the functionality for various child instances to append &#x60;ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED&#x60; event and for &#x60;SERVICE_TASK&#x60; type child to append &#x60;Job:MIGRATED&#x60; event. 
 
Now, users are able to successfully migrate service task instances and jobs. Additionally, it&#x27;s possible to use all job commands like activate, fail, throwError, yield, complete, etc. during the process migration.

#### [Introduce new compensation subscription record](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15063)

The system previously lacked a method of effectively tracking completed activities with compensation handlers, causing inefficiencies and potential inconsistencies. 
The absence of a specific record for compensation events was the root cause. This omission made it challenging to keep track of the compensation handler&#x27;s state and made it difficult to identify the compensation throw event that triggered a compensation handler.
A new record was introduced for compensation events. It is designed to track completed activities with compensation handlers and monitor the state of the compensation handlers. This record is equipped to manage the lifecycle of the compensation, which includes states like &#x27;CREATED&#x27;, &#x27;TRIGGERED&#x27;, &#x27;COMPLETED&#x27;, and &#x27;DELETED&#x27;. 
With the implementation of the new compensation record, the system now effectively tracks and manages activities with compensation handlers. It can also efficiently identify the compensation throw event responsible for triggering a compensation handler. The process of keeping track of the state of compensation handlers is now more streamlined, enhancing the overall performance of the system.
#### [Add Job Update Timeout intents](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15034)

The system was unable to adjust the timeouts for jobs once they had been set, leaving users without the ability to extend or shorten the allotted time for jobs according to project requirements. 
The job handling system lacked the &#x60;UPDATE_TIMEOUT&#x60; intent. Therefore, it couldn&#x27;t locate the job in the state or its deadline. Also, the system was not designed to update the &#x60;JOB_DEADLINES&#x60; ColumnFamily because of the fixed key it used. 
Added the &#x60;UPDATE_TIMEOUT&#x60; intent to the &#x60;JobIntent&#x60; class which looks through the state for the needed job and its deadline. If found, it writes the &#x60;TIMEOUT_UPDATED&#x60; event, effectively changing the deadline in the state. Additionally, adjusted the behavior of &#x60;TIMEOUT_UPDATED&#x60; event to allow modifications in the &#x60;JOB_DEADLINES&#x60; ColumnFamily, implementing a removal of the existing entry for the job and insertion of a new value.
Users can now manage the duration of jobs by updating their timeouts. The system correctly finds the job and its current deadline and applies the requested changes, giving users greater control over their workflows.
#### [I can execute a process with a compensation end event](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14967)

 Users were able to deploy a process with a compensation end event, but attempting to execute the process did not invoke the compensation handlers. Despite the successful completion of the process instances that contained a compensation end event, the compensation end event would activate and complete without properly recording the event type as &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60;. 
 The system was originally designed to ignore the invocation of compensation handlers during the process execution, effectively lacking the feature to handle compensation events properly.
 Refined the process execution regulation to engage with compensation handlers. The system was updated to allow for successful completion of process instances that contained compensation end events while activating and interacting with the associated compensation handlers.
 Now, when a process with a compensation end event is executed, the compensation handlers are activated and the event is accurately logged as a &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type. The process instance can complete successfully, and every action is appropriately recorded.
#### [I can execute a process with an intermediate compensation throw event](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14965)

 Previously, users were unable to execute a process that included an intermediate compensation throw event. While deployment of such a process was possible, attempts at execution were unsuccessful.
 The underlying issue was a lack of support for the invocation of compensation handlers during the execution of a process with a compensation intermediate throw event.
 We implemented a mechanism to activate and complete a compensation intermediate throw event within the process instance. We also added the event type &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; to the records for the compensation intermediate throw event.
 Now, users can successfully execute a process that includes a compensation intermediate throw event. The event activates and completes as expected, allowing the full process instance to be completed. Additionally, the related event records correctly reflect the &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type.

#### [The record for a compensation event has the correct event type](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14944)

 Compensation events in the execution of a BPMN process were not accurately represented. These events were not properly labeled with a dedicated event type, resulting in an ambiguous or inaccurate record of the event types in the &#x60;ProcessInstance&#x60;.
 In the past, the field &#x60;bpmnEventType&#x60; did not include a &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; type. Hence, events related to BPMN compensation such as compensation intermediate throwing events, compensation end events, compensation boundary events, and compensation start events were all missing the required &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type.
 We introduced a new &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type in &#x60;BpmnEventType.java&#x60; to reflect the execution of compensation events accurately in the BPMN process. 
 Now, all events related to a BPMN compensation event are accurately tagged with the &#x60;COMPENSATION&#x60; event type. As a result, the record for a compensation event now has the correct event type, which allows for a more accurate record-keeping and understanding of the process instance.
#### [I can deploy a process with BPMN compensation event subprocesses](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14943)

 
Users were unable to deploy a process with BPMN compensation event subprocesses due to the existing validation rules.
 
The issue arose from validation rules that did not allow compensation start events within event subprocesses. 
 
The validation rules were adjusted to permit compensation start events within event subprocesses. Additionally, restrictions were set in place to ensure a compensation start event is within an event subprocess and a compensation event subprocess is inside an embedded subprocess. Processes at the top level were not permitted to host the event subprocess.
 
Users can now deploy a process with BPMN compensation event subprocesses aligning with the updated validation rules and the designated restrictions. The issue of being unable to deploy processes with these specific subprocesses has been resolved.
#### [I can deploy a process with BPMN compensation events](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14942)

 Users were unable to deploy a process with BPMN compensation events due to the validation rules that were in place. 
 The system&#x27;s validation rules were not designed to allow the inclusion of specific BPMN elements such as Compensation intermediate throwing event, Compensation end event, Compensation boundary event, and Activity with compensation marker. 
 The validation rules were adjusted to allow the aforementioned BPMN elements. Enhanced restrictions were also put into place to maintain a secure and effective deployment process. 
 Users are now able to deploy a process that includes BPMN compensation events, with the system ensuring a safe and reliable process.
#### [I can model a process with compensation events via BPMN model API](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14939)

 Users previously found creating a process via builder with compensation events via BPMN model API to be verbose and clunky. They found it difficult to create test cases for compensation events due to the unintuitive process.
 The existing BPMN model API&#x27;s structure for handling compensation events lacked clarity and efficiency. This was highlighted in the complicated Java code necessary for a simple compensation process.
 We have revised and streamlined the builder, making it more user-friendly and efficient. The codes have been simplified to enable easier creation of test cases for compensation events. 
 When creating a process with compensation events through the builder in the BPMN model API, users now have a smoother and more intuitive experience. The simplified process now enables easier and more efficient generation of test cases.
#### [Add support to Java client for Form deletion](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14858)

Users were unable to delete Forms using the Java client. 
The functionality for Form deletion was not implemented in the Java client&#x27;s code. 
The necessary code was added to the Java client to enable Form deletion. 
Users can now delete Forms directly through the Java client.
#### [Replace Dependabot with Renovate](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14701)

 The project had Dependabot and Renovate both operating in the repository, which brought about redundancy and Dependabot failed to cover all use cases. This inefficient setup caused extra load and confusion.
 The project was configured to use both Dependabot and Renovate for dependency updates. While Dependabot was managing the update for maven and docker, Renovate was solely managing all other dependencies.
 The functionality of Dependabot was shifted to Renovate by altering the renovate.json to also look after the maven and docker updates. A pull request was filed and merged to remove the Dependabot tool.
 Now, the project uses only Renovate for dependency updates. This streamlined approach reduces redundancy and enhances efficiency. Further PRs will validate the change. The titles and commit messages from Renovate were corrected for clarity. The removal of Dependabot related Github actions is pending.
#### [Use caching for Forms](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14562)

Users experienced slow performance during forms retrieval, because the system was not using any caching mechanism for recently retrieved forms. 
The underlying issue was the absence of a caching mechanism in the DbFormState. This situation arose when forms were introduced to Zeebe in 8.3 without incorporating a cache system for performance enhancement. 
A caching mechanism was implemented to DbFormState, using a similar process to that applied to Decision and Process states.
Forms retrieval is now faster due to the application of a caching mechanism for recently accessed forms. Users should observe more efficient data retrieval and improved performance.
#### [Support multi-tenancy for Resource Deletion](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14279)

 Previously, the process of resource deletion was not accommodating multi-tenancy. That made the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; incapable of looking up resources using authorized tenant IDs, causing a limitation in the system functioning in tenant-aware environments.
 The issue occurred due to the absence of a multi-tenant capability in the design of the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; functionality. This resulted in it not being capable of identifying resources connected with distinct tenant IDs.
 Changes were made to allow the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; to lookup resources using authorized tenant IDs. In addition, unit tests and QA tests were added specifically for tenant-aware resource deletion. The previously inactive tests in the engine&#x27;s &#x60;TenantAwareTimerStartEventTest&#x60; were re-enabled to support this enhancement.
 Now, the &#x60;ResourceDeletionProcessor&#x60; successfully recognises and handles resources associated with various tenants. This denotes that the system can function proficiently in multi-tenant scenarios, thereby offering improved performance and versatility. Various tests are also now active, ensuring consistent system integrity in multi-tenant environments.
#### [Support deletion of the Forms through DeleteResource gRPC](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14272)

Previously, users were unable to delete Forms using DeleteResource gRPC method.
This issue was due to the lack of support for Forms resource deletion in the DeleteResource gRPC.
Developers extended the DeleteResource gRPC method to handle Form resource deletion.
Users can now delete Forms via DeleteResource gRPC, offering a more flexible management of Forms.

#### [Keep track of event types in the Engine](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13433)

Users were previously unable to keep track of event types that triggered elements in Grafana, as these event types were not added to the job metric in the Engine.
The &#x60;ProcessEngineMetrics&#x60; class did not have a method for event types for &#x60;element_instance_events_total&#x60; metric, resulting in a lack of detailed information for activated, completed, and terminated element instances in Grafana. 
The &#x60;ProcessEngineMetrics&#x60; class was updated to include event type indicators for activated, completed, and terminated element instances in the &#x60;element_instance_events_total&#x60; metric. An additional label was also added to this metric to track the &#x60;eventType&#x60;.
Users can now directly monitor event types that trigger specific elements in Grafana, providing more concise and detailed system insights.
#### [Indicate the type of activated/completed/terminated catch events in Grafana](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13410)

 Previously, users reported that the Engine was lagging behind while processing new records. It was hard to identify the type of catch events causing the issue, so the problem was difficult to troubleshoot in Grafana without resorting to additional log resources.
 The incident was caused by a timer catch event that was generating multiple new records, overloading the thread pool. As a result, the specific type of catch event that was contributing to the lag wasn&#x27;t identifiable in Grafana&#x27;s &#x27;General Overview -&gt; Current Events&#x27; view. 
 We added the type of catch events to Grafana&#x27;s &#x27;General Overview -&gt; Current Events&#x27; view. Now, every element instance contains its own type. 
 Users can now differentiate between types of catch events directly in the Grafana view. This feature aids users in identifying problem sources quickly and simplifies troubleshooting.
#### [Zeebe supports multi-tenancy for BPMN signal events](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13336)

 
Before this update, Zeebe did not support multi-tenancy for BPMN signal events. This hampered the ability for different tenants to broadcast their own distinct signals, resulting in a lack of necessary separation and potential confusion when handling multiple processes.
 
The underlying issue was that the &#x60;SignalSubscriptionState&#x60; could not persist the &#x60;tenantId&#x60;, and the engine was unable to process &#x60;SignalRecord&#x60; commands with a tenant ID. This led to a lack of multi-tenancy support in the ProcessingStates used by signal broadcasting.
 
We modified the &#x60;SignalSubscriptionState&#x60; to accommodate the &#x60;tenantId&#x60;, and updated the engine to process &#x60;SignalRecord&#x60; commands with a tenant ID. We also provided multi-tenancy data migration for the ProcessingStates used by signal broadcasting. Further, the Elasticsearch/Opensearch record templates were updated to include a &#x60;tenantId&#x60; property.
 
Zeebe now correctly supports multi-tenancy for BPMN signal events. Each tenant can broadcast their own specific signals, enabling clearer process definition and control across different tenants. The addition of the &#x60;tenantId&#x60; property facilitates identification and streamlines multi-tenant operations.
### Zeebe > Misc > Bug Fixes
#### [After cancellation, a completed change operation should not overwrite updated topology](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15726)

Users experienced their updated topology being erroneously overwritten after the completion of a change operation that was cancelled.
The cancel operation was not blocking subsequent completion signals that had already been dispatched before the cancellation request, due to a flaw in the signal propagation mechanism.
Our team addressed this issue by modifying the signal propagation mechanism to properly account for cancellation requests. Absolute priority was given to the cancel signal, ensuring that completion signals dispatched before the cancellation do not carry out their actions post-cancellation.
Now, if a user cancels a change operation, the system successfully blocks any completion signals tied to that operation from being enacted, even if they were dispatched prior to the cancellation. Accordingly, a previously updated topology will remain as intended without being rewritten after a cancelled operation.
#### [Special characters in static inputs should not be escaped](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15447)

 Users were experiencing an issue where special characters in static input data were being unnecessarily escaped. For instance, if the user provided input as &quot;Hello\n\nYOU!&quot;, it would be converted to &quot;Hello\\\\n\\\\nYOU!&quot;.
 Due to an oversight in the programming code, the product was mistakenly escaping special characters in amounts twice as expected.
 Developers addressed this problem by updating the encoding configuration and fixing the string manipulation code so that special characters in static inputs weren&#x27;t excessively escaped.
 Now, in the updated version of the software, special characters in static input are processed correctly, behaving as intended, and providing a more reliable user experience.
#### [Verify correct behaviour of input mappings after bump to FEEL 1.17.3](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15445)

Previously, special characters inside input mappings were being escaped unintentionally.
This issue occurred due to a bug in the FEEL 1.17.3 related to escaping special characters.
The software was updated to the revised version of FEEL 1.17.3, which resolved the issue with escaping special characters.
Now, special characters within input mappings are no longer being escaped.
#### [Could not update new leader for partition](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15188)

 
In the past, when a new leader was scheduled to be assigned to a partition, the update failed to take place. This lack of leadership was detrimental for the stable functioning of the system, with no additional details visible in the logs.
 
The underlying mechanism for electing a new leader for the partition was faulty. The system was expecting a non-null value for the current leader term, but instead found a null value, which led to the update failure.
 
We introduced a robust system to correctly perform the leadership election, ensuring that null values would not be encountered during a new leader&#x27;s assignment.
 
Now, whenever there is a need for a new leader in a partition, the system successfully updates the leader. This improved mechanism ensures the seamless functioning of the system.
#### [A deployed form is not mentioned in the &#x60;DeploymentEventImpl.toString()&#x60;](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14931)

 
Users had previously been unable to see mention of a deployed form in the &#x60;DeploymentEventImpl.toString()&#x60; output.
 
The underlying issue was due to an oversight in the software development process - deployed forms were not added in the &#x60;DeploymentEvent&#x60; print out, which is largely due to the employment of the Java client on a Windows OS.
 
An update to the implementation of &#x60;DeploymentEventImpl.toString()&#x60; was made, ensuring forms are now included in the output when deployed using the java client Zeebe Version: 8.3.0.
 
Now, when a form is deployed using the Java client, &#x27;DeploymentEvent&#x27; correctly includes and displays the deployed form. The system behavior now aligns with user expectations.
#### [UDP resource leaks](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14837)

In versions 8.4.0-SNAPSHOT CW42 and CW43, users experienced a significant UDP resource leak which maxed out UDP listening connections over time. This led to widespread DNS failures and, ultimately, disk space depletion as data could not be exported anymore. 
The underlying issue was found in the Java process where the amounts of open UDP connections were constantly on the rise. This unusual pattern conflicted with the expected baseline of 2 open UDP connections related to our Netty unicast service and some temporary ones.
The issue was resolved by addressing the UDP resource leaks in the Java process. Modifications were implemented to ensure that the number of UDP connections didn&#x27;t exceed the baseline.
Now, the system correctly sustains only the baseline UDP connections, eliminating the previous resource leak. Consequently, DNS failures related to this issue are avoided and data export functions normally, preventing disk space fill up.
#### [Job streams not aggregated correctly on gateway](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14773)

Before the fix, users observed that job streams weren&#x27;t being aggregated correctly on the gateway. Two client streams with identical parameters were assigned different server stream IDs, contradicting the expected behaviour.
The issue was due to the inconsistent implementation of &#x27;equals&#x27; and &#x27;hashCode&#x27; for &#x27;ArrayProperty&#x27; and &#x27;ArrayValue&#x27;. These methods relied on the last modification being reflected in their internal buffer, but this was not consistently the case.
To resolve this, we adjusted the &#x27;equals&#x27; and &#x27;hashCode&#x27; methods in &#x27;ArrayProperty&#x27; and &#x27;ArrayValue&#x27;. Now, they no longer rely solely on the last modification reflected in the internal buffer.
With the fix applied, client streams that are logically equivalent are now correctly aggregated on the gateway. If users create two identical job streams, they should see two client streams on the gateway, each possessing the correct corresponding server stream ID.
#### [Job streams not registered on broker after some time](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14771)

In the past, users experienced an issue where two out of three brokers had no job streams registered and only one was aware of those streams. Inconsistent gateway and broker stream states resulted in the gateway not aggregating streams as expected.
This issue was due to a technical flaw where a restart streams request was not sent to the gateway when it rejoined. This technical error caused the streams not to recreate themselves when the member was locally removed or re-added.
A fix was implemented whereby a restart streams request is now correctly sent to the gateway when it rejoins, ensuring the streams are recreated as necessary.
Now, gateway and broker stream states are consistent, with streams being properly registered across all brokers. Streams are also correctly aggregated by the gateway as designed, leading to a more reliable and operational system.
#### [Regular OOM when replicating large state due to messaging timeouts](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14663)

 Users were experiencing regular out-of-memory errors with the system when trying to replicate snapshot files that are larger than 4GB. This was primarily due to issues with the system&#x27;s &#x60;NettyMessagingService&#x60;&#x27;s timeout executor.
 The underlying issue was found in the code where scheduled lambda captures the complete message. When replicating large snapshots, it led to large system messages, causing memory to be overflowed.
 A correction was made in the code logic to avoid closing over the complete message during snapshot replication. The message is now only used for logging, reducing memory usage.
 Now, users can replicate large snapshot files without the system running out of memory. This greatly improves system performance and reliability when handling larger amounts of data.
#### [ NullPointerException: Cannot invoke &#x60;PartitionContext.getComponentHealthMonitor()&#x60; because &#x60;this.context&#x60; is null ](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14458)

 Previously, during Zeebe&#x27;s shutdown process, users occasionally experienced a NullPointerException (NPE) while the healthcheck service was trying to query the health of a Zeebe partition.
 This error was brought about because the system tried to invoke &#x60;PartitionContext.getComponentHealthMonitor()&#x60; when &#x60;this.context&#x60; was null.
 To correct this issue, a null check has been implemented. If the system finds &#x60;this.context&#x60; to be null, it now returns unhealthy in place of throwing an NPE.
 Now, when shutting down Zeebe, the health checks for the partitions occur without causing an NPE, even when &#x60;this.context&#x60; is null. Users should no longer experience these exceptions during shutdown.
#### [Snapshot version of  benchmark application (starter/worker) doesn&#x27;t work with SaaS](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14047)

 Previously, the benchmark starter and worker couldn&#x27;t communicate with SaaS clusters correctly. Users had to resort to an old version to maintain functionality. 
 The problem lay in the improper configuration of the client builder, which was fixed to use plaintext rather than correctly connecting to SaaS. The configuration defaults resulted in the benchmark applications attempting to communicate through HTTP instead of HTTPS.
 The issue was addressed by making necessary adjustments to the client builder to stop using plaintext and to initiate the right connection to SaaS. The TLS configuration of the benchmark app was tuned to ensure the switch from HTTP to HTTPS.
 Now, the benchmark starter and worker can connect and communicate with SaaS clusters seamlessly without requiring any outdated versions. The fix in the TLS configuration now ensures proper secure communication.
#### [EvaluateDecision request returns double quoted string](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13551)

 Users were facing unexpected behaviour when using the EvaluateDecisionCommand as the output was being returned as a double quoted string.
 The problem originated from how Zeebe was transforming the returned value into an internal Zeebe value. This led to the output being double quoted rather than a singular quoted string.
 The issue was resolved by modifying the way Zeebe transforms the returned value into an internal Zeebe value, ensuring the output is returned as a single quoted string rather than a doubly quoted string. 
 Now when users evaluate a decision with the EvaluateDecisionCommand, they receive the output as a single quoted string, making the response more intuitive and consistent with standard practices.

#### [Feel error are causing bad user experiences](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/8938)

 Users previously encountered issues and frustration while creating instances using a misformatted FEEL expression, with the software yielding incidents that provided unclear messages about the underlying problem.
 The issue arose because the system was unable to effectively detect and communicate mismatches between expected and actual functions in FEEL expressions. The system&#x27;s logs referenced a missing function, but this information was inaccessible to users who lacked access to the logs.
 We have updated our system to append warnings gathered from the evaluation of FEEL expressions into the resulting incident messages, providing the user with actionable insights into the problems with their instances.
 Now, when a user creates an instance using an incorrectly formatted FEEL expression, the resulting incident message will clearly list the issues with the expression, making it easier for the user to rectify the problem. In turn, this improves the usability of our system and lessens user frustration.
#### [After cancellation, a completed change operation should not overwrite updated topology](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15726)

Users experienced their updated topology being erroneously overwritten after the completion of a change operation that was cancelled.
The cancel operation was not blocking subsequent completion signals that had already been dispatched before the cancellation request, due to a flaw in the signal propagation mechanism.
Our team addressed this issue by modifying the signal propagation mechanism to properly account for cancellation requests. Absolute priority was given to the cancel signal, ensuring that completion signals dispatched before the cancellation do not carry out their actions post-cancellation.
Now, if a user cancels a change operation, the system successfully blocks any completion signals tied to that operation from being enacted, even if they were dispatched prior to the cancellation. Accordingly, a previously updated topology will remain as intended without being rewritten after a cancelled operation.
#### [Special characters in static inputs should not be escaped](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15447)

 Users were experiencing an issue where special characters in static input data were being unnecessarily escaped. For instance, if the user provided input as &quot;Hello\n\nYOU!&quot;, it would be converted to &quot;Hello\\\\n\\\\nYOU!&quot;.
 Due to an oversight in the programming code, the product was mistakenly escaping special characters in amounts twice as expected.
 Developers addressed this problem by updating the encoding configuration and fixing the string manipulation code so that special characters in static inputs weren&#x27;t excessively escaped.
 Now, in the updated version of the software, special characters in static input are processed correctly, behaving as intended, and providing a more reliable user experience.
#### [Verify correct behaviour of input mappings after bump to FEEL 1.17.3](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15445)

Previously, special characters inside input mappings were being escaped unintentionally.
This issue occurred due to a bug in the FEEL 1.17.3 related to escaping special characters.
The software was updated to the revised version of FEEL 1.17.3, which resolved the issue with escaping special characters.
Now, special characters within input mappings are no longer being escaped.
#### [NullPointerException when join is retried after a restart](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15381)

Users experienced an encountered NullPointerException and subsequent stalled join operation when retrying the join after a restart during the testing of pod restarts&#x27; impact during dynamic scaling. 
The issue originated from the underlying logic where the leader did not send the configuration again on receiving a duplicate join request. This was because it assumed the server already had the required configuration. This assumption led to a NullPointerException when an Append request was sent. 
The issue was addressed in two parts. Initially, we have enhanced the logic of the leader to make it re-send the configuration upon receiving a duplicate join request. On top of this, we have handled the NullPointerException in the follower by simply rejecting the AppendRequest, ensuring that the follower eventually receives the new configuration.
With these fixes applied, the system no longer encounters NullPointerException during a join operation retry after a restart. Furthermore, the system can now handle duplicate join requests more efficiently, which positively affects dynamic scaling during pod restarts.
#### [IT timeout due to &#x60;ScaleResiliencyTest.ScaleDown&#x60;](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15343)

 
Users previously experienced timeouts during operations due to a bug in the &#x60;ScaleResiliencyTest.ScaleDown&#x60; test, which blocked the merging of changes. 
 
The error was caused by &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; attempting to leave &#x60;partition 2&#x60; but failing initially due to the unavailability of &#x60;Broker-1&#x60;. &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; had already committed the first part of the joint consensus. The operation was only successful after a restart of &#x60;Broker-2&#x60;, though in some cases &#x60;partition 2&#x60; in &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; was not ready. As a result, when &#x60;Broker-0&#x60; (the leader) committed the second part of the joint consensus before &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; was ready, &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; stayed forever waiting for &#x60;partition-2&#x60; to be ready. 
 
The issue was resolved by ensuring that &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; is ready before &#x60;Broker-1&#x60; comes up. This solution guarantees that the &#x60;startupFuture&#x60; in Partition&#x27;s StartupProcess is completed before moving on to additional operations. 
 
Now, users can execute operations without experiencing timeouts, and &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; no longer waits indefinitely for &#x60;partition-2&#x60; to be ready. The testing environment is more stable, allowing for contributions without the worry of unexpected blockages.
#### [Form events are not replayed](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15194)


Users experienced a potential loss of deployed forms. When this occurred, newly activated User Tasks raised an Incident indicating that the Form could not be found.
The issue transpired due to form events not being replayed in the replay mode, leading to the absence of these events in Zeebe. Consequently, existing jobs of User Tasks may still be referring to the key of a form, but it no longer exists in Zeebe.
The bug was corrected to ensure Form events are adequately replayed in the replay mode. 
Now, no form events are missed, and they are added correctly to the state. Incidents will no longer be raised at the User Task about missing forms. If the user activates User Task with form id set after the replay, it&#x27;s guaranteed to find the Form events.
#### [Could not update new leader for partition](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15188)

 
In the past, when a new leader was scheduled to be assigned to a partition, the update failed to take place. This lack of leadership was detrimental for the stable functioning of the system, with no additional details visible in the logs.
 
The underlying mechanism for electing a new leader for the partition was faulty. The system was expecting a non-null value for the current leader term, but instead found a null value, which led to the update failure.
 
We introduced a robust system to correctly perform the leadership election, ensuring that null values would not be encountered during a new leader&#x27;s assignment.
 
Now, whenever there is a need for a new leader in a partition, the system successfully updates the leader. This improved mechanism ensures the seamless functioning of the system.
#### [Avoid executing process according to unprocessed commands referring to source process definition](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15129)

 
Users experienced incorrect execution of process instances after migration if those instances were not entirely in a wait state. This was due to unprocessed commands referring to the source process definition might still exist on the log stream with a position higher than the process instance migration command. 
 
During the processing of these commands, the engine wrongly attempted to continue the processing on the source process definition as if no migration had occurred.
 
The issue was resolved by choosing to not trust the process definition key in such commands but instead look up the process definition from the state when processing commands. This approach became a requirement for any command processor to simplify reasoning about the system and bring consistency to the implementation.
 
In the fixed version, the system correctly executes migrated process instances regardless of their state when migrated. This is due to the system now verifies process definition from its current state when processing commands, accounting for any migration that has taken place.
#### [8.3.x release benchmark - Authorization data unavailable: The Token can&#x27;t be used before xxx](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15047)


Users of our system were met with the error &quot;Authorization data unavailable: The Token can&#x27;t be used before xxx&quot;, causing a DEAD partition.
This error was caused by the system comparing Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) times for both JWT issuing and verification through &#x60;Instant.now()&#x60;. Due to the absence of leeway, even a slight desynchronization between the gateway node and broker node results in invalid token verification.
The &#x60;issuedAt&#x60; claim was removed from the JWT token and the JWT validation was disabled when decoding the token. The system now validates the &#x60;authorized_tenants&#x60; JWT claim by checking for its presence.
Now, the system&#x27;s operation doesn&#x27;t run into errors due to synchronization issues between different nodes. It only checks for essential information i.e., &#x60;authorized_tenants&#x60; in the JWT which mitigates previous issues.
#### [A deployed form is not mentioned in the &#x60;DeploymentEventImpl.toString()&#x60;](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14931)

 
Users had previously been unable to see mention of a deployed form in the &#x60;DeploymentEventImpl.toString()&#x60; output.
 
The underlying issue was due to an oversight in the software development process - deployed forms were not added in the &#x60;DeploymentEvent&#x60; print out, which is largely due to the employment of the Java client on a Windows OS.
 
An update to the implementation of &#x60;DeploymentEventImpl.toString()&#x60; was made, ensuring forms are now included in the output when deployed using the java client Zeebe Version: 8.3.0.
 
Now, when a form is deployed using the Java client, &#x27;DeploymentEvent&#x27; correctly includes and displays the deployed form. The system behavior now aligns with user expectations.
#### [IOPS doubled in CW44](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14924)

 In CW44, there was an unusual event where some nodes were intermittently performing up to 8000 IOPS instead of the usual ~4000 from previous benchmarks. This issue created unexpectedly high I/O operations on certain nodes despite having well-balanced leaderships and similar journal append rates and leader commit rates.
 The underlying cause of the issue was identified as the system potentially counting some metrics twice. This issue was reminiscent of a previous issue with CPU tracking, where duplicated metrics led to inaccuracies in usage estimations.
 A fix was applied to ensure that metrics are no longer redundantly calculated. The doubling issue was investigated thoroughly, and it was discovered that two different containers and two services were the caused the issue. The issue was rectified by correctly associating the metrics with their respective containers and services.
 Currently, all nodes perform with the expected IOPS, providing accurate and consistent benchmarks. The fix led to improved precision in the system&#x27;s resource tracking, enabling all nodes to perform I/O operations within the predicted levels. Consequently, there are no more nodes doing _way_ more I/O than others.
#### [Improve resilience of remote stream restart](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14884)

 
In the past, whenever a new member was added, brokers naively requested restart of all streams. This led to some disturbance as some brokers were not equipped to handle these requests. Moreover, transient failures in stream restarts weren&#x27;t rectified as there was lack of failure retry mechanism.
 
The system was originally engineered to send out requests for stream restart to all members indiscriminately, instead of targeting only the gateways. Furthermore, no system component was responsible for retrying failed stream restarts, which often led to an inconsistent state with unknown streams on the brokers.
 
A feature was introduced to limit the stream restart requests to gateways only. Additionally, a retry mechanism was implemented to handle failures, allowing for multiple retries until the request is successfully executed.
Brokers now send stream restart requests exclusively to gateways, decreasing system noise and increasing efficiency. If a stream restart request fails, the system automatically attempts a retry with a backoff, ensuring that all streams are recognised on the brokers.
#### [UDP resource leaks](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14837)

In versions 8.4.0-SNAPSHOT CW42 and CW43, users experienced a significant UDP resource leak which maxed out UDP listening connections over time. This led to widespread DNS failures and, ultimately, disk space depletion as data could not be exported anymore. 
The underlying issue was found in the Java process where the amounts of open UDP connections were constantly on the rise. This unusual pattern conflicted with the expected baseline of 2 open UDP connections related to our Netty unicast service and some temporary ones.
The issue was resolved by addressing the UDP resource leaks in the Java process. Modifications were implemented to ensure that the number of UDP connections didn&#x27;t exceed the baseline.
Now, the system correctly sustains only the baseline UDP connections, eliminating the previous resource leak. Consequently, DNS failures related to this issue are avoided and data export functions normally, preventing disk space fill up.
#### [Leaked message subscriptions cause constant processing load](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14814)

 Before the fix, a sustained processing load was observed on the Zeebe 8.2.12 Cluster due to leaked message subscriptions. 
 This was caused by an unresolved issue where the &#x60;PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker&#x60; continuously wrote &#x60;PROCESS_MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/CORRELATE&#x60; commands for entries in &#x60;MutablePendingMessageSubscriptionState&#x60;. Meanwhile, the &#x60;ProcessMessageSubscriptionCorrelateProcessor&#x60; failed to find a matching subscription and kept writing a &#x60;COMMAND_REJECTION&#x60; and a &#x60;MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT&#x60; command. 
 The issue was tackled by modifying the handling of &#x60;MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT&#x60; and &#x60;COMMAND_REJECTION&#x60; commands. The recommendation was made to clean up the subscription when the receiving partition rejected it, and to cease writing &#x60;COMMAND_REJECTION&#x60;s for internal commands not sent by a user.
 With this fix, the sustained processing load due to leaked message subscriptions is mitigated. The system now handles &#x60;MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT&#x60; and &#x60;COMMAND_REJECTION&#x60; commands more efficiently, avoiding constant resending of notifications and unnecessarily maintaining rejected subscriptions.
#### [Job streams not aggregated correctly on gateway](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14773)

Before the fix, users observed that job streams weren&#x27;t being aggregated correctly on the gateway. Two client streams with identical parameters were assigned different server stream IDs, contradicting the expected behaviour.
The issue was due to the inconsistent implementation of &#x27;equals&#x27; and &#x27;hashCode&#x27; for &#x27;ArrayProperty&#x27; and &#x27;ArrayValue&#x27;. These methods relied on the last modification being reflected in their internal buffer, but this was not consistently the case.
To resolve this, we adjusted the &#x27;equals&#x27; and &#x27;hashCode&#x27; methods in &#x27;ArrayProperty&#x27; and &#x27;ArrayValue&#x27;. Now, they no longer rely solely on the last modification reflected in the internal buffer.
With the fix applied, client streams that are logically equivalent are now correctly aggregated on the gateway. If users create two identical job streams, they should see two client streams on the gateway, each possessing the correct corresponding server stream ID.
#### [Job streams not registered on broker after some time](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14771)

In the past, users experienced an issue where two out of three brokers had no job streams registered and only one was aware of those streams. Inconsistent gateway and broker stream states resulted in the gateway not aggregating streams as expected.
This issue was due to a technical flaw where a restart streams request was not sent to the gateway when it rejoined. This technical error caused the streams not to recreate themselves when the member was locally removed or re-added.
A fix was implemented whereby a restart streams request is now correctly sent to the gateway when it rejoins, ensuring the streams are recreated as necessary.
Now, gateway and broker stream states are consistent, with streams being properly registered across all brokers. Streams are also correctly aggregated by the gateway as designed, leading to a more reliable and operational system.
#### [IllegalStateException: found snapshot 0. A previous snapshot is most likely corrupted](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14699)

 
Users experienced an IllegalStateException error, finding snapshot 0 during the startup of the broker Zeebe, an indication of probable snapshot corruption. The broker was unable to boot, hindering user operations.
 
This issue was caused by a failure in the snapshot integrity check, which resulted from a flaw in the changes made to the snapshot. Specifically, the integrity check was not performed after moving the snapshot, leading to potential corruption. Additionally, the checksum file was found to be empty due to a separate bug that led to a crash before the writing could be completed. 
 
We repaired this issue by implementing a fix that ensures the snapshot&#x27;s integrity check is properly executed after the move operation and identifies any incomplete moves. Furthermore, we resolved the bug that caused the crash during the checksum file writing process to prevent the generation of an empty checksum file.
 
Now, the broker Zeebe starts up as expected without encountering snapshot 0, allowing the boot process to complete. This results in a smoother user experience with reduced risk of snapshot corruption.
#### [Regular OOM when replicating large state due to messaging timeouts](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14663)

 Users were experiencing regular out-of-memory errors with the system when trying to replicate snapshot files that are larger than 4GB. This was primarily due to issues with the system&#x27;s &#x60;NettyMessagingService&#x60;&#x27;s timeout executor.
 The underlying issue was found in the code where scheduled lambda captures the complete message. When replicating large snapshots, it led to large system messages, causing memory to be overflowed.
 A correction was made in the code logic to avoid closing over the complete message during snapshot replication. The message is now only used for logging, reducing memory usage.
 Now, users can replicate large snapshot files without the system running out of memory. This greatly improves system performance and reliability when handling larger amounts of data.
#### [MsgpackReaderException when reading TenantId](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14624)


Previously, users encountered a &#x60;MsgpackReaderException&#x60; during job push operations in an experimental release, which caused subsequent system instability and failures when a broker led multiple partitions. This caused job push operations to become non-functional, impacting the system&#x27;s efficiency. 
The issue arose from an unsynchronized access pattern to &#x60;JobActivationPropertiesImpl&#x60; in the job streamer, an instance shared among multiple partitions in a broker. The problem exacerbated when brokers led more than one partition, resulting in concurrent untenable mutations of an &#x60;ArrayProperty&#x60;.
The issue was resolved with a dual-approach fix. Firstly, a &#x27;quick-fix&#x27; was implemented, which surfaced as cloning the job activation properties in &#x60;BpmnJobActivationBehavior&#x60; before retrieving the list of tenants. This cloning enabled the isolation of multiple partitions and their operations over the &#x60;ArrayProperty&#x60;. Secondly, an additional maintenance-friendly fix was prepared, wherein the engine was wrapped with a partition-aware facade that can duplicate information when needed, keeping redundancy at bay.
Following the implementation of these fixes, users no longer experience &#x60;MsgpackReaderException&#x60; during job push operations. The system stability and performance in brokers leading multiple partitions are now enhanced, as concurrent mutations are avoided, and job push operations are functional again. Clients can use the system more effectively, and job push operations can seamlessly proceed without disruptions.

#### [NPE in &#x60;PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker&#x60;](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14588)

In the past, the PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker failed and caused a Null Pointer Exception (NPE) during its concurrent execution together with the stream processor. This made the shared transitory state unsynchronized and led to a disruption in regular processing, decreasing the system’s availability.
This issue was caused by a race condition in a section of the system where the PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker accessed a shared in-memory state concurrently with the stream processor. The transient state was accessed in a thread-safe manner, but not across multiple calls, which made the states unsynchronized. 
A null-check was introduced to verify the presence of the subscription before its retrieval. If the subscription was missing, an informative log message was generated to indicate its removal from the state. This modification was made to handle the case when the message subscription record is correlated or deleted from the state.
The system can now handle the concurrent execution of the PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker with the stream processor without triggering a Null Pointer Exception. This ensures synchronization between the transient and persisting states alongside uninterrupted regular processing, promoting increased system availability.
#### [ NullPointerException: Cannot invoke &#x60;PartitionContext.getComponentHealthMonitor()&#x60; because &#x60;this.context&#x60; is null ](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14458)

 Previously, during Zeebe&#x27;s shutdown process, users occasionally experienced a NullPointerException (NPE) while the healthcheck service was trying to query the health of a Zeebe partition.
 This error was brought about because the system tried to invoke &#x60;PartitionContext.getComponentHealthMonitor()&#x60; when &#x60;this.context&#x60; was null.
 To correct this issue, a null check has been implemented. If the system finds &#x60;this.context&#x60; to be null, it now returns unhealthy in place of throwing an NPE.
 Now, when shutting down Zeebe, the health checks for the partitions occur without causing an NPE, even when &#x60;this.context&#x60; is null. Users should no longer experience these exceptions during shutdown.
#### [Failed jobs are not reactivate after backoff](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14329)


E2E tests were persistently failing as certain jobs associated with &#x60;send-message-ping&#x60; or &#x60;send-message-pong&#x60; tasks were getting stuck and were not re-activating after a certain backoff timeout. The user was unable to reactivate the jobs manually too, resulting in uncompleted tasks.
Upon further probing, it was discovered that the failure and stuck jobs were due to resource exhaustion, caused by broker restarts and a change in leadership. However, the main issue lay in the implementation. The JobBackoffCleanupMigration had a condition wherein the job was removed from the Job_Backoff column family if the backoff time did not match the record. Since the backoff time was conflated with the timepoint at which the backoff should expire, this condition did not work as expected causing jobs to be lost to potential reactivation.
A fix was implemented to correct the condition in the JobBackoffCleanupMigration so that jobs were not incorrectly removed from the Job_Backoff column family. The stored backoff in the column family now correctly corresponds to the record backoff.
With the new fix in place, jobs failing due to a change in broker state will now be re-activated correctly after the retry backoff of 30 seconds. The E2E tests now run successfully as the &#x60;send-message-ping&#x60; or &#x60;send-message-pong&#x60;
#### [Snapshot version of  benchmark application (starter/worker) doesn&#x27;t work with SaaS](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14047)

 Previously, the benchmark starter and worker couldn&#x27;t communicate with SaaS clusters correctly. Users had to resort to an old version to maintain functionality. 
 The problem lay in the improper configuration of the client builder, which was fixed to use plaintext rather than correctly connecting to SaaS. The configuration defaults resulted in the benchmark applications attempting to communicate through HTTP instead of HTTPS.
 The issue was addressed by making necessary adjustments to the client builder to stop using plaintext and to initiate the right connection to SaaS. The TLS configuration of the benchmark app was tuned to ensure the switch from HTTP to HTTPS.
 Now, the benchmark starter and worker can connect and communicate with SaaS clusters seamlessly without requiring any outdated versions. The fix in the TLS configuration now ensures proper secure communication.
#### [Scheduled tasks should avoid overloading the streamprocessor](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13870)

 Previously, scheduled tasks for job deadlines were continuously appending the same &#x60;Job:TIME_OUT&#x60; command, thereby overloading the stream processor if it got blocked. This issue was common among a number of scheduled tasks.
 This was due to a lack of a mechanism to prevent scheduled tasks from appending the same command multiple times. 
 A cache of recently appended commands was introduced for scheduled tasks to fix the problem. This generic functionality allows all scheduled tasks to avoid the repetition of commands.
 After the application of this fix, scheduled tasks now avoid overloading the stream processor by using the cache to prevent appending the same command multiple times. Thus, stream processors experience reduced load, enhancing their performance.
#### [EvaluateDecision request returns double quoted string](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13551)

 Users were facing unexpected behaviour when using the EvaluateDecisionCommand as the output was being returned as a double quoted string.
 The problem originated from how Zeebe was transforming the returned value into an internal Zeebe value. This led to the output being double quoted rather than a singular quoted string.
 The issue was resolved by modifying the way Zeebe transforms the returned value into an internal Zeebe value, ensuring the output is returned as a single quoted string rather than a doubly quoted string. 
 Now when users evaluate a decision with the EvaluateDecisionCommand, they receive the output as a single quoted string, making the response more intuitive and consistent with standard practices.

#### [Feel error are causing bad user experiences](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/8938)

 Users previously encountered issues and frustration while creating instances using a misformatted FEEL expression, with the software yielding incidents that provided unclear messages about the underlying problem.
 The issue arose because the system was unable to effectively detect and communicate mismatches between expected and actual functions in FEEL expressions. The system&#x27;s logs referenced a missing function, but this information was inaccessible to users who lacked access to the logs.
 We have updated our system to append warnings gathered from the evaluation of FEEL expressions into the resulting incident messages, providing the user with actionable insights into the problems with their instances.
 Now, when a user creates an instance using an incorrectly formatted FEEL expression, the resulting incident message will clearly list the issues with the expression, making it easier for the user to rectify the problem. In turn, this improves the usability of our system and lessens user frustration.
#### [Verify correct behaviour of input mappings after bump to FEEL 1.17.3](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15445)

Previously, special characters inside input mappings were being escaped unintentionally.
This issue occurred due to a bug in the FEEL 1.17.3 related to escaping special characters.
The software was updated to the revised version of FEEL 1.17.3, which resolved the issue with escaping special characters.
Now, special characters within input mappings are no longer being escaped.
#### [NullPointerException when join is retried after a restart](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15381)

Users experienced an encountered NullPointerException and subsequent stalled join operation when retrying the join after a restart during the testing of pod restarts&#x27; impact during dynamic scaling. 
The issue originated from the underlying logic where the leader did not send the configuration again on receiving a duplicate join request. This was because it assumed the server already had the required configuration. This assumption led to a NullPointerException when an Append request was sent. 
The issue was addressed in two parts. Initially, we have enhanced the logic of the leader to make it re-send the configuration upon receiving a duplicate join request. On top of this, we have handled the NullPointerException in the follower by simply rejecting the AppendRequest, ensuring that the follower eventually receives the new configuration.
With these fixes applied, the system no longer encounters NullPointerException during a join operation retry after a restart. Furthermore, the system can now handle duplicate join requests more efficiently, which positively affects dynamic scaling during pod restarts.
#### [IT timeout due to &#x60;ScaleResiliencyTest.ScaleDown&#x60;](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15343)

 
Users previously experienced timeouts during operations due to a bug in the &#x60;ScaleResiliencyTest.ScaleDown&#x60; test, which blocked the merging of changes. 
 
The error was caused by &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; attempting to leave &#x60;partition 2&#x60; but failing initially due to the unavailability of &#x60;Broker-1&#x60;. &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; had already committed the first part of the joint consensus. The operation was only successful after a restart of &#x60;Broker-2&#x60;, though in some cases &#x60;partition 2&#x60; in &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; was not ready. As a result, when &#x60;Broker-0&#x60; (the leader) committed the second part of the joint consensus before &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; was ready, &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; stayed forever waiting for &#x60;partition-2&#x60; to be ready. 
 
The issue was resolved by ensuring that &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; is ready before &#x60;Broker-1&#x60; comes up. This solution guarantees that the &#x60;startupFuture&#x60; in Partition&#x27;s StartupProcess is completed before moving on to additional operations. 
 
Now, users can execute operations without experiencing timeouts, and &#x60;Broker-2&#x60; no longer waits indefinitely for &#x60;partition-2&#x60; to be ready. The testing environment is more stable, allowing for contributions without the worry of unexpected blockages.
#### [Form events are not replayed](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15194)


Users experienced a potential loss of deployed forms. When this occurred, newly activated User Tasks raised an Incident indicating that the Form could not be found.
The issue transpired due to form events not being replayed in the replay mode, leading to the absence of these events in Zeebe. Consequently, existing jobs of User Tasks may still be referring to the key of a form, but it no longer exists in Zeebe.
The bug was corrected to ensure Form events are adequately replayed in the replay mode. 
Now, no form events are missed, and they are added correctly to the state. Incidents will no longer be raised at the User Task about missing forms. If the user activates User Task with form id set after the replay, it&#x27;s guaranteed to find the Form events.
#### [Could not update new leader for partition](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15188)

 
In the past, when a new leader was scheduled to be assigned to a partition, the update failed to take place. This lack of leadership was detrimental for the stable functioning of the system, with no additional details visible in the logs.
 
The underlying mechanism for electing a new leader for the partition was faulty. The system was expecting a non-null value for the current leader term, but instead found a null value, which led to the update failure.
 
We introduced a robust system to correctly perform the leadership election, ensuring that null values would not be encountered during a new leader&#x27;s assignment.
 
Now, whenever there is a need for a new leader in a partition, the system successfully updates the leader. This improved mechanism ensures the seamless functioning of the system.
#### [8.3.x release benchmark - Authorization data unavailable: The Token can&#x27;t be used before xxx](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15047)


Users of our system were met with the error &quot;Authorization data unavailable: The Token can&#x27;t be used before xxx&quot;, causing a DEAD partition.
This error was caused by the system comparing Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) times for both JWT issuing and verification through &#x60;Instant.now()&#x60;. Due to the absence of leeway, even a slight desynchronization between the gateway node and broker node results in invalid token verification.
The &#x60;issuedAt&#x60; claim was removed from the JWT token and the JWT validation was disabled when decoding the token. The system now validates the &#x60;authorized_tenants&#x60; JWT claim by checking for its presence.
Now, the system&#x27;s operation doesn&#x27;t run into errors due to synchronization issues between different nodes. It only checks for essential information i.e., &#x60;authorized_tenants&#x60; in the JWT which mitigates previous issues.
#### [A deployed form is not mentioned in the &#x60;DeploymentEventImpl.toString()&#x60;](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14931)

 
Users had previously been unable to see mention of a deployed form in the &#x60;DeploymentEventImpl.toString()&#x60; output.
 
The underlying issue was due to an oversight in the software development process - deployed forms were not added in the &#x60;DeploymentEvent&#x60; print out, which is largely due to the employment of the Java client on a Windows OS.
 
An update to the implementation of &#x60;DeploymentEventImpl.toString()&#x60; was made, ensuring forms are now included in the output when deployed using the java client Zeebe Version: 8.3.0.
 
Now, when a form is deployed using the Java client, &#x27;DeploymentEvent&#x27; correctly includes and displays the deployed form. The system behavior now aligns with user expectations.
#### [IOPS doubled in CW44](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14924)

 In CW44, there was an unusual event where some nodes were intermittently performing up to 8000 IOPS instead of the usual ~4000 from previous benchmarks. This issue created unexpectedly high I/O operations on certain nodes despite having well-balanced leaderships and similar journal append rates and leader commit rates.
 The underlying cause of the issue was identified as the system potentially counting some metrics twice. This issue was reminiscent of a previous issue with CPU tracking, where duplicated metrics led to inaccuracies in usage estimations.
 A fix was applied to ensure that metrics are no longer redundantly calculated. The doubling issue was investigated thoroughly, and it was discovered that two different containers and two services were the caused the issue. The issue was rectified by correctly associating the metrics with their respective containers and services.
 Currently, all nodes perform with the expected IOPS, providing accurate and consistent benchmarks. The fix led to improved precision in the system&#x27;s resource tracking, enabling all nodes to perform I/O operations within the predicted levels. Consequently, there are no more nodes doing _way_ more I/O than others.
#### [Improve resilience of remote stream restart](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14884)

 
In the past, whenever a new member was added, brokers naively requested restart of all streams. This led to some disturbance as some brokers were not equipped to handle these requests. Moreover, transient failures in stream restarts weren&#x27;t rectified as there was lack of failure retry mechanism.
 
The system was originally engineered to send out requests for stream restart to all members indiscriminately, instead of targeting only the gateways. Furthermore, no system component was responsible for retrying failed stream restarts, which often led to an inconsistent state with unknown streams on the brokers.
 
A feature was introduced to limit the stream restart requests to gateways only. Additionally, a retry mechanism was implemented to handle failures, allowing for multiple retries until the request is successfully executed.
Brokers now send stream restart requests exclusively to gateways, decreasing system noise and increasing efficiency. If a stream restart request fails, the system automatically attempts a retry with a backoff, ensuring that all streams are recognised on the brokers.
#### [Leaked message subscriptions cause constant processing load](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14814)

 Before the fix, a sustained processing load was observed on the Zeebe 8.2.12 Cluster due to leaked message subscriptions. 
 This was caused by an unresolved issue where the &#x60;PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker&#x60; continuously wrote &#x60;PROCESS_MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/CORRELATE&#x60; commands for entries in &#x60;MutablePendingMessageSubscriptionState&#x60;. Meanwhile, the &#x60;ProcessMessageSubscriptionCorrelateProcessor&#x60; failed to find a matching subscription and kept writing a &#x60;COMMAND_REJECTION&#x60; and a &#x60;MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT&#x60; command. 
 The issue was tackled by modifying the handling of &#x60;MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT&#x60; and &#x60;COMMAND_REJECTION&#x60; commands. The recommendation was made to clean up the subscription when the receiving partition rejected it, and to cease writing &#x60;COMMAND_REJECTION&#x60;s for internal commands not sent by a user.
 With this fix, the sustained processing load due to leaked message subscriptions is mitigated. The system now handles &#x60;MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT&#x60; and &#x60;COMMAND_REJECTION&#x60; commands more efficiently, avoiding constant resending of notifications and unnecessarily maintaining rejected subscriptions.
#### [IllegalStateException: found snapshot 0. A previous snapshot is most likely corrupted](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14699)

 
Users experienced an IllegalStateException error, finding snapshot 0 during the startup of the broker Zeebe, an indication of probable snapshot corruption. The broker was unable to boot, hindering user operations.
 
This issue was caused by a failure in the snapshot integrity check, which resulted from a flaw in the changes made to the snapshot. Specifically, the integrity check was not performed after moving the snapshot, leading to potential corruption. Additionally, the checksum file was found to be empty due to a separate bug that led to a crash before the writing could be completed. 
 
We repaired this issue by implementing a fix that ensures the snapshot&#x27;s integrity check is properly executed after the move operation and identifies any incomplete moves. Furthermore, we resolved the bug that caused the crash during the checksum file writing process to prevent the generation of an empty checksum file.
 
Now, the broker Zeebe starts up as expected without encountering snapshot 0, allowing the boot process to complete. This results in a smoother user experience with reduced risk of snapshot corruption.
#### [ NullPointerException: Cannot invoke &#x60;PartitionContext.getComponentHealthMonitor()&#x60; because &#x60;this.context&#x60; is null ](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14458)

 Previously, during Zeebe&#x27;s shutdown process, users occasionally experienced a NullPointerException (NPE) while the healthcheck service was trying to query the health of a Zeebe partition.
 This error was brought about because the system tried to invoke &#x60;PartitionContext.getComponentHealthMonitor()&#x60; when &#x60;this.context&#x60; was null.
 To correct this issue, a null check has been implemented. If the system finds &#x60;this.context&#x60; to be null, it now returns unhealthy in place of throwing an NPE.
 Now, when shutting down Zeebe, the health checks for the partitions occur without causing an NPE, even when &#x60;this.context&#x60; is null. Users should no longer experience these exceptions during shutdown.
#### [Scheduled tasks should avoid overloading the streamprocessor](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13870)

 Previously, scheduled tasks for job deadlines were continuously appending the same &#x60;Job:TIME_OUT&#x60; command, thereby overloading the stream processor if it got blocked. This issue was common among a number of scheduled tasks.
 This was due to a lack of a mechanism to prevent scheduled tasks from appending the same command multiple times. 
 A cache of recently appended commands was introduced for scheduled tasks to fix the problem. This generic functionality allows all scheduled tasks to avoid the repetition of commands.
 After the application of this fix, scheduled tasks now avoid overloading the stream processor by using the cache to prevent appending the same command multiple times. Thus, stream processors experience reduced load, enhancing their performance.
#### [Feel error are causing bad user experiences](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/8938)

 Users previously encountered issues and frustration while creating instances using a misformatted FEEL expression, with the software yielding incidents that provided unclear messages about the underlying problem.
 The issue arose because the system was unable to effectively detect and communicate mismatches between expected and actual functions in FEEL expressions. The system&#x27;s logs referenced a missing function, but this information was inaccessible to users who lacked access to the logs.
 We have updated our system to append warnings gathered from the evaluation of FEEL expressions into the resulting incident messages, providing the user with actionable insights into the problems with their instances.
 Now, when a user creates an instance using an incorrectly formatted FEEL expression, the resulting incident message will clearly list the issues with the expression, making it easier for the user to rectify the problem. In turn, this improves the usability of our system and lessens user frustration.
#### [UDP resource leaks](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14837)

In versions 8.4.0-SNAPSHOT CW42 and CW43, users experienced a significant UDP resource leak which maxed out UDP listening connections over time. This led to widespread DNS failures and, ultimately, disk space depletion as data could not be exported anymore. 
The underlying issue was found in the Java process where the amounts of open UDP connections were constantly on the rise. This unusual pattern conflicted with the expected baseline of 2 open UDP connections related to our Netty unicast service and some temporary ones.
The issue was resolved by addressing the UDP resource leaks in the Java process. Modifications were implemented to ensure that the number of UDP connections didn&#x27;t exceed the baseline.
Now, the system correctly sustains only the baseline UDP connections, eliminating the previous resource leak. Consequently, DNS failures related to this issue are avoided and data export functions normally, preventing disk space fill up.
#### [Job streams not aggregated correctly on gateway](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14773)

Before the fix, users observed that job streams weren&#x27;t being aggregated correctly on the gateway. Two client streams with identical parameters were assigned different server stream IDs, contradicting the expected behaviour.
The issue was due to the inconsistent implementation of &#x27;equals&#x27; and &#x27;hashCode&#x27; for &#x27;ArrayProperty&#x27; and &#x27;ArrayValue&#x27;. These methods relied on the last modification being reflected in their internal buffer, but this was not consistently the case.
To resolve this, we adjusted the &#x27;equals&#x27; and &#x27;hashCode&#x27; methods in &#x27;ArrayProperty&#x27; and &#x27;ArrayValue&#x27;. Now, they no longer rely solely on the last modification reflected in the internal buffer.
With the fix applied, client streams that are logically equivalent are now correctly aggregated on the gateway. If users create two identical job streams, they should see two client streams on the gateway, each possessing the correct corresponding server stream ID.
#### [Job streams not registered on broker after some time](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14771)

In the past, users experienced an issue where two out of three brokers had no job streams registered and only one was aware of those streams. Inconsistent gateway and broker stream states resulted in the gateway not aggregating streams as expected.
This issue was due to a technical flaw where a restart streams request was not sent to the gateway when it rejoined. This technical error caused the streams not to recreate themselves when the member was locally removed or re-added.
A fix was implemented whereby a restart streams request is now correctly sent to the gateway when it rejoins, ensuring the streams are recreated as necessary.
Now, gateway and broker stream states are consistent, with streams being properly registered across all brokers. Streams are also correctly aggregated by the gateway as designed, leading to a more reliable and operational system.
#### [IllegalStateException: found snapshot 0. A previous snapshot is most likely corrupted](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14699)

 
Users experienced an IllegalStateException error, finding snapshot 0 during the startup of the broker Zeebe, an indication of probable snapshot corruption. The broker was unable to boot, hindering user operations.
 
This issue was caused by a failure in the snapshot integrity check, which resulted from a flaw in the changes made to the snapshot. Specifically, the integrity check was not performed after moving the snapshot, leading to potential corruption. Additionally, the checksum file was found to be empty due to a separate bug that led to a crash before the writing could be completed. 
 
We repaired this issue by implementing a fix that ensures the snapshot&#x27;s integrity check is properly executed after the move operation and identifies any incomplete moves. Furthermore, we resolved the bug that caused the crash during the checksum file writing process to prevent the generation of an empty checksum file.
 
Now, the broker Zeebe starts up as expected without encountering snapshot 0, allowing the boot process to complete. This results in a smoother user experience with reduced risk of snapshot corruption.
#### [Regular OOM when replicating large state due to messaging timeouts](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14663)

 Users were experiencing regular out-of-memory errors with the system when trying to replicate snapshot files that are larger than 4GB. This was primarily due to issues with the system&#x27;s &#x60;NettyMessagingService&#x60;&#x27;s timeout executor.
 The underlying issue was found in the code where scheduled lambda captures the complete message. When replicating large snapshots, it led to large system messages, causing memory to be overflowed.
 A correction was made in the code logic to avoid closing over the complete message during snapshot replication. The message is now only used for logging, reducing memory usage.
 Now, users can replicate large snapshot files without the system running out of memory. This greatly improves system performance and reliability when handling larger amounts of data.
#### [MsgpackReaderException when reading TenantId](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14624)


Previously, users encountered a &#x60;MsgpackReaderException&#x60; during job push operations in an experimental release, which caused subsequent system instability and failures when a broker led multiple partitions. This caused job push operations to become non-functional, impacting the system&#x27;s efficiency. 
The issue arose from an unsynchronized access pattern to &#x60;JobActivationPropertiesImpl&#x60; in the job streamer, an instance shared among multiple partitions in a broker. The problem exacerbated when brokers led more than one partition, resulting in concurrent untenable mutations of an &#x60;ArrayProperty&#x60;.
The issue was resolved with a dual-approach fix. Firstly, a &#x27;quick-fix&#x27; was implemented, which surfaced as cloning the job activation properties in &#x60;BpmnJobActivationBehavior&#x60; before retrieving the list of tenants. This cloning enabled the isolation of multiple partitions and their operations over the &#x60;ArrayProperty&#x60;. Secondly, an additional maintenance-friendly fix was prepared, wherein the engine was wrapped with a partition-aware facade that can duplicate information when needed, keeping redundancy at bay.
Following the implementation of these fixes, users no longer experience &#x60;MsgpackReaderException&#x60; during job push operations. The system stability and performance in brokers leading multiple partitions are now enhanced, as concurrent mutations are avoided, and job push operations are functional again. Clients can use the system more effectively, and job push operations can seamlessly proceed without disruptions.

#### [NPE in &#x60;PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker&#x60;](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14588)

In the past, the PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker failed and caused a Null Pointer Exception (NPE) during its concurrent execution together with the stream processor. This made the shared transitory state unsynchronized and led to a disruption in regular processing, decreasing the system’s availability.
This issue was caused by a race condition in a section of the system where the PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker accessed a shared in-memory state concurrently with the stream processor. The transient state was accessed in a thread-safe manner, but not across multiple calls, which made the states unsynchronized. 
A null-check was introduced to verify the presence of the subscription before its retrieval. If the subscription was missing, an informative log message was generated to indicate its removal from the state. This modification was made to handle the case when the message subscription record is correlated or deleted from the state.
The system can now handle the concurrent execution of the PendingMessageSubscriptionChecker with the stream processor without triggering a Null Pointer Exception. This ensures synchronization between the transient and persisting states alongside uninterrupted regular processing, promoting increased system availability.
#### [Snapshot version of  benchmark application (starter/worker) doesn&#x27;t work with SaaS](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14047)

 Previously, the benchmark starter and worker couldn&#x27;t communicate with SaaS clusters correctly. Users had to resort to an old version to maintain functionality. 
 The problem lay in the improper configuration of the client builder, which was fixed to use plaintext rather than correctly connecting to SaaS. The configuration defaults resulted in the benchmark applications attempting to communicate through HTTP instead of HTTPS.
 The issue was addressed by making necessary adjustments to the client builder to stop using plaintext and to initiate the right connection to SaaS. The TLS configuration of the benchmark app was tuned to ensure the switch from HTTP to HTTPS.
 Now, the benchmark starter and worker can connect and communicate with SaaS clusters seamlessly without requiring any outdated versions. The fix in the TLS configuration now ensures proper secure communication.

#### [Add missing steps to developer handbook](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15287)

 Previously, developers encountered bug reports and CI failures when attempting to add new record types due to certain missing steps in the developer handbook.
 The developer handbook lacked crucial instructions about including new value types in the engine&#x27;s supported value types for event replay and support for a new value type in Zeebe Process Test (ZPT).
 We enhanced the developer handbook by including the previously missing steps. Details about integrating new value types in the engine&#x27;s supported list for event replay and in the Zeebe Process Test (ZPT) are now available.
 With this fix, developers now have an accurate guide when adding new record types, reducing the likelihood of bug reports and CI failures.

### Zeebe > Misc > Merged Pull Requests
#### [build(topology): add backward compatibility check for protobuf messages](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15744)

The topology module allowed backward incompatible changes to protobuf messages, disrupting system functionality. 
Absence of a check and restriction mechanism to prevent any backward incompatible modifications to the protobuf messages in the topology module.
Added a maven plugin that acts as a safeguard against such backward incompatible changes. 
Now, the topology module maintains backward compatibility with protobuf messages, ensuring error-free adjustments and better system stability.
#### [fix(topology): do not update the topology if the operation was cancelled](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15727)

Previously, changes were incorrectly applied to a cancelled topology if the operation was successful post-cancellation. 
This was due to a lack of checks comparing the expected and current topology before applying changes. 
A comparison check was introduced, ensuring changes were only applied if the expected and current topology matched. 
Now, the system prevents incorrect alterations to a cancelled topology by pre-validating the topology before making any updates.
#### [fix(topology): maintain gossip state update ordering](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15709)

Users were experiencing inconsistencies and unexpected behaviors in system topology due to randomness in gossip state update ordering.
The inherent randomness in the ordering of gossip state updates, due to concurrent data processing, led to differences in state across the nodes in the network. 
Developers resolved the issue by implementing code changes that ensure the consistent ordering of gossip state updates for network nodes.
Users can now observe that the system topology remains consistent and behaves predictably across all nodes without experiencing intermittent or inexplicable changes in gossip updates ordering.

Kindly provide more information, especially the problem caused, so I can generate a precise release note considering the consequence, cause, fix, and the result of the fix.
#### [fix(github): new project automation token for add-to-projects](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15619)

Users were unable to add new projects to the platform due to an invalid token. 
The previous automation token used for adding projects had expired.
We generated and implemented a new project automation token. 
Users can now seamlessly add new projects to the platform.
#### [Revert &quot;fix(github): use project admin token for project query&quot;](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15618)

#### [Fix the current ES dashboard](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15390)

 The Elasticsearch (ES) dashboard was broken, hindering users&#x27; ability to export it via sharing or externally. 
 This issue resulted from recent changes to the code (https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15350) affecting how the ES dashboard could be exported. 
 We restored a previous version of the dashboard and re-exported it, overcoming the export glitches.
 The Elasticsearch dashboard is now functioning correctly and can be shared or exported externally as intended.
#### [fix: set correct generation](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15341)

 Users experienced issues with incorrect generation settings as a result of incorrectly referenced variables, causing difficulty in tracking due to the long names.
 The issue was induced by the wrong variables being referenced, thus causing an incorrect set up of the generations. 
 We adjusted the generation settings by referencing the correct variables. Steps were also taken to evaluate the possibility of shortening the variable names to ease tracking.
 Now, the generations are correctly set, which makes it quite straightforward to manage and track. Possible future shortening of the names for better usability is still under consideration.

#### [Calculate the right versions](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15340)

Previously, users were facing issues with the version calculation, as it was not functioning correctly without the patch versions.
The problem was because the portion of code that handled the version was removed inadvertently, and this removal broke the correct functioning of version calculation.
The necessary code for the version calculation was reintroduced, ensuring that the calculation would still function correctly without requiring heavy refactoring.
Now, users can expect the version calculation to function properly, with or without the patch versions in place.
#### [refactor: allow easy disabling via secret removal](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15317)

Users were unable to easily disable TCC by simply removing the secret.
The application was not originally designed to allow easy disabling of TCC through the removal of the secret.
A refactoring was performed to make it possible for TCC to be disabled by simply removing the secret.
Users can now easily disable TCC by simply removing the secret.
#### [Replay deployed forms](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15201)

Users experienced a problem where &#x60;Form&#x60; records were not being replayed in the Engine records, resulting in a lack of access to previously deployed forms.
The underlying cause was that these &#x60;Form&#x60; records were not included in the Engine&#x27;s supported records. 
The &#x60;Form&#x60; records have now been added to the Engine&#x27;s list of record types to be replayed. A test case was also added as a regression measure. 
The Engine now successfully replays &#x60;Form&#x60; records, providing users with access to their previously deployed forms.
#### [Aa update ci after 8.3 minor release](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/14631)

 Post the 8.3 minor release, Continuous Integration (CI) was not being updated as expected.
 The engineering workflow regarding the update of Continuous Integration after a minor version release was not working properly.
 The issue was corrected by updating the CI post the release of the 8.3 minor version.
 Now, following the release of any minor versions, Continuous Integration is expected to update correctly.
#### [fix(clients/go): client does not retry on permanent errors](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/14217)


Users were experiencing incidents where commands did not stop on permanent errors, eventually causing unexpected retries.
The code handling permanent errors within the client was not correctly distinguishing them as non-retry-able issues, causing unneeded, repetitive operations.
 
The error management was improved to properly recognize permanent errors as non-retry-able, thus stopping subsequent commands immediately upon encountering such issues.
 
Now, the client effectively stops commands on permanent errors, preventing unnecessary retries and enhancing the overall efficiency and stability of the system.
#### [[Backport stable/1.2] Fixes flakiness with the ElasticsearchExporter integration tests](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/8203)

Users previously experienced intermittent issues while running ElasticsearchExporter integration tests.
This was traced back to a fault in the system&#x27;s alignment with &#x27;stable/1.2&#x27; that featured incompatibilities.
We executed a backport of #8194 to &#x27;stable/1.2&#x27; to rectify this problem.
Now the ElasticsearchExporter integration tests operate reliably and without any unforeseen interruptions.
#### [build(topology): add backward compatibility check for protobuf messages](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15744)

Kindly provide more information, especially the problem caused, so I can generate a precise release note considering the consequence, cause, fix, and the result of the fix.
#### [fix(github): new project automation token for add-to-projects](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15619)

Users were unable to add new projects to the platform due to an invalid token. 
The previous automation token used for adding projects had expired.
We generated and implemented a new project automation token. 
Users can now seamlessly add new projects to the platform.
#### [Revert &quot;fix(github): use project admin token for project query&quot;](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15618)

Apologies for the confusion, but I don&#x27;t see a specific issue described in the details provided. If you could provide a more descriptive issue or problem encountered, I would be better equipped to help generate an appropriate release note. The format is as follows:
1. Consequence - Describe the impact of the issue with the observable behaviour of the system for the user, written in the past tense.
2. Cause - Explain the underlying cause of the issue in terms of the technical engineering of the product, written in the past tense.
3. Fix - A brief description of the technical fix to the product, written in the past tense.
4. Result - A description of the observable behaviour of the system for the user after the fix is applied, written in present tense.
#### [fix(github): fixed for add to projects workflow](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15617)

 Before the fix was applied, users encountered a warning concerning variable settings in the &quot;add to projects&quot; workflow. In addition, the &quot;if conditions&quot; were not functioning as intended due to the &#x60;has-project&#x60; step resulting in a string instead of a boolean, which caused issues in the workflow. Furthermore, using the GitHub repo token to query the project led to an absence of results because the repo token had no access to projects.
 The issue originated from the way variables were set in the programming code, an incorrect assumption that the result of the &#x60;has-project&#x60; step was a boolean, and the use of the GitHub repo token instead of the project admin token for the project query.
 The variable settings were refined, solving the initial warning. The condition checks for the&#x60;has-project&#x60; step were corrected to anticipate a string outcome instead of a boolean, and the project admin token was used in the project query instead of the GitHub repo token.
 As of this version, users no longer come across a warning about variable settings in the &#x27;add to projects&#x27; workflow. Condition checks within the workflow correctly handle the activities of the &#x60;has-project&#x60; step, and the project query returns the appropriate results since it now holds access to projects by using the project admin token.
#### [Handle job worker back pressure/yield as an expected case](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15508)

 In the past, job worker back pressure was considered an error state and was logged at an error level. This could cause confusion as it was an expected state rather than an error. Also, the logic for pushing to the client from the gateway was incorporated in the &#x60;AggregatedClientStream&#x60; and &#x60;ClientStreamImpl&#x60; classes, which made them more complex than necessary and could slow down their efficiency.
 Back pressure was incorrectly interpreted as an error, leading to excessive error logging. This problem arose due to the function of job yielding on the broker side triggering logs at the error level when back pressure occurred. Additionally, the &#x60;AggregatedClientStream&#x60; and &#x60;ClientStreamImpl&#x60; classes were overloaded with logic beyond their data classes purpose; they contained the logic for pushing data to the client from the gateway.
 We downgraded the job worker back pressure from an error state to an expected state, modifying the system logs to trace level instead of error level and focusing more on metrics for tracking frequent blockages. The logic for pushing to the client from the gateway was moved out of the &#x60;AggregatedClientStream&#x60; and &#x60;ClientStreamImpl&#x60; classes into a dedicated class, &#x60;ClientStreamPusher&#x60;.
 When back pressure is encountered, it&#x27;s now treated as an expected state, not an error state, and logs regarding this matter are generated at the trace level. This can improve debugging as error logs are now more representative of unexpected issues. Furthermore, with the segregation of the push-to-client logic into its own class, the &#x60;AggregatedClientStream&#x60; and &#x60;ClientStreamImpl&#x60; classes are now just data classes providing a clearer and more efficient structure.
#### [Fix the current ES dashboard](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15390)

 The Elasticsearch (ES) dashboard was broken, hindering users&#x27; ability to export it via sharing or externally. 
 This issue resulted from recent changes to the code (https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15350) affecting how the ES dashboard could be exported. 
 We restored a previous version of the dashboard and re-exported it, overcoming the export glitches.
 The Elasticsearch dashboard is now functioning correctly and can be shared or exported externally as intended.
#### [fix: set correct generation](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15341)

 Users experienced issues with incorrect generation settings as a result of incorrectly referenced variables, causing difficulty in tracking due to the long names.
 The issue was induced by the wrong variables being referenced, thus causing an incorrect set up of the generations. 
 We adjusted the generation settings by referencing the correct variables. Steps were also taken to evaluate the possibility of shortening the variable names to ease tracking.
 Now, the generations are correctly set, which makes it quite straightforward to manage and track. Possible future shortening of the names for better usability is still under consideration.

#### [Calculate the right versions](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15340)

Previously, users were facing issues with the version calculation, as it was not functioning correctly without the patch versions.
The problem was because the portion of code that handled the version was removed inadvertently, and this removal broke the correct functioning of version calculation.
The necessary code for the version calculation was reintroduced, ensuring that the calculation would still function correctly without requiring heavy refactoring.
Now, users can expect the version calculation to function properly, with or without the patch versions in place.
#### [refactor: allow easy disabling via secret removal](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15317)

Users were unable to easily disable TCC by simply removing the secret.
The application was not originally designed to allow easy disabling of TCC through the removal of the secret.
A refactoring was performed to make it possible for TCC to be disabled by simply removing the secret.
Users can now easily disable TCC by simply removing the secret.
#### [Replay deployed forms](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15201)

Users experienced a problem where &#x60;Form&#x60; records were not being replayed in the Engine records, resulting in a lack of access to previously deployed forms.
The underlying cause was that these &#x60;Form&#x60; records were not included in the Engine&#x27;s supported records. 
The &#x60;Form&#x60; records have now been added to the Engine&#x27;s list of record types to be replayed. A test case was also added as a regression measure. 
The Engine now successfully replays &#x60;Form&#x60; records, providing users with access to their previously deployed forms.
#### [Aa update ci after 8.3 minor release](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/14631)

 Post the 8.3 minor release, Continuous Integration (CI) was not being updated as expected.
 The engineering workflow regarding the update of Continuous Integration after a minor version release was not working properly.
 The issue was corrected by updating the CI post the release of the 8.3 minor version.
 Now, following the release of any minor versions, Continuous Integration is expected to update correctly.
#### [fix(clients/go): client does not retry on permanent errors](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/14217)


Users were experiencing incidents where commands did not stop on permanent errors, eventually causing unexpected retries.
The code handling permanent errors within the client was not correctly distinguishing them as non-retry-able issues, causing unneeded, repetitive operations.
 
The error management was improved to properly recognize permanent errors as non-retry-able, thus stopping subsequent commands immediately upon encountering such issues.
 
Now, the client effectively stops commands on permanent errors, preventing unnecessary retries and enhancing the overall efficiency and stability of the system.
#### [[Backport stable/1.2] Fixes flakiness with the ElasticsearchExporter integration tests](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/8203)

Users previously experienced intermittent issues while running ElasticsearchExporter integration tests.
This was traced back to a fault in the system&#x27;s alignment with &#x27;stable/1.2&#x27; that featured incompatibilities.
We executed a backport of #8194 to &#x27;stable/1.2&#x27; to rectify this problem.
Now the ElasticsearchExporter integration tests operate reliably and without any unforeseen interruptions.
#### [fix(raft): resend configuration to members that lost their configuration](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15444)

 Users experienced issues related to the configuration of replication group members. The leader in the group was tracking configuration indices of members inaccurately, particularly when members lost configurations due to data loss or uncommitted configurations, leading to a need to restart the leader or create a new configuration for resolution.
 This was caused by the system only updating the configuration index when receiving a successful configuration response. This method failed to account for instances where the leaders&#x27; understanding of members&#x27; configuration index remained outdated or nonexistent due to various disruptions.
 We introduced changes in the communication between the leader and members. Now, the append response contains the configuration index, enabling the leader to update the index as it receives an append response. Additionally, followers can signal to the leader when a configuration is outdated or missing. Further, we enabled followers to reject append requests in the absence of a current configuration. As for backwards compatibility, we did accommodate older versions of followers who do not send a configuration index. 
 As a result of these changes, the system now provides a more robust replication group configuration management. Leaders can accurately determine and update the configuration status of members, making the system more resilient to disruptions. The process is also streamlined for followers, as they have the option to decline append requests if they cannot determine a current configuration. Furthermore, the changes support older version followers, ensuring smooth operations in mixed environments.

#### [Failed or cancelled topology change operations block further operations](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15220)

Previously, users experienced an issue where failed or cancelled topology change operations hindered subsequent operations from being initiated.
This was due to the &#x60;onGoingTopologyChangeOperation&#x60; flag within &#x60;ClusterTopologyManager&#x60; only being reset to &#x60;false&#x60; after a successful operation. The flag was not reset if an operation was cancelled or if an initialization failed. As a result, if new operations emerged, the manager would not initiate them since &#x60;onGoingTopologyChangeOperation&#x60; was still set to &#x60;true&#x60;.
This issue has been addressed by revising the mechanism to ensure the &#x60;onGoingTopologyChangeOperation&#x60; flag is reset to &#x60;false&#x60; not only when operation is successful, but also in the event of cancelation or initialization failure.
Now, regardless of whether an operation fails, is cancelled or is successful, it will no longer block future operations, providing a smoother user experience with less potential for operational disruption.
#### [Topology received via gossip can bypass merge with locally persisted topology](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15219)

In the past, brokers could unintentionally forget about already applied operations due to bypasses in the merging with locally persisted topology.
This occurred because a broker could receive a new topology via gossip before the &#x60;TopologyInitializer&#x60; had finished its process. As a result, the locally persisted topology was uninitialized, which led to the received topology being persisted without proper merging.
The exception has been set exclusively for &#x60;GossipInitializer&#x60;, preventing topology updates received via gossip from overwriting an uninitialized topology. 
Now, brokers maintain knowledge of all applied operations, regardless of when the topology updates have been received. As a result, there are no interruptions or bypasses in the merging process with locally persisted topology.
#### [Static user task assignee value treated as number (leads to an exception)](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14109)

Consistent crashing of user tasks with static number values as assignees was experienced, with an exception being thrown (&quot;Expected result of the expression &#x27;1547044236679495680&#x27; to be &#x27;STRING&#x27;, but was &#x27;NUMBER&#x27;&quot;).
The underlying problem was that the user task assignee was processed as a numerical FEEL expression rather than a static number when being converted to a string, even when it was designated as a static value.
We corrected this by modifying the processing of user task assignees so that static number values are treated as string values and not as FEEL expressions. 
Users can now run user tasks with static numbers as assignees without encountering crashes. The static number assignee value will be correctly treated as a string without exceptions being thrown.

#### [Potential inconsistency in raft after restoring from a backup](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14509)

 After restoring from a backup, some partitions encountered an IllegalStateException. This was typically accompanied by a growth in disk usage and potential inconsistencies in the Raft protocol behavior. Users might have noticed a notable difference in log compaction and an increase in disk space consumption. 
 Upon recovery from a backup, the Raft metastore was found empty. This led to a restart of the term from 1, potentially causing inconsistencies in cases where the term of the last entry in the log was greater than 1. An increase in disk usage was also observed as no new snapshots could be taken until the term was elevated to a value higher than the one before the backup.
 A solution to this problem was implemented in [PR#15272](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15272).
 With the introduced fix, users should no longer see inconsistencies in the Raft protocol after restoring from a backup. The issue of increased disk usage has also been resolved, leading to smoother operations and better management of space. Raft should now continue working as expected in all scenarios post restoration.
#### [Deleting a process definition only checks running instances and doesn&#x27;t ignore banned instances](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14465)

 
Users were previously unable to delete a process definition if it had any banned instances, even if there were no running instances. This was because the system was mistakenly considering banned instances as running instances when checking prior to deletion.
The process definition deletion was built to reject any deletion command if there were any running instances associated with that definition. However, it did not differentiate between running and banned instances. Additionally, the check was only run on the partition that received the command, leading to inconsistencies between partitions if there were banned instances on other partitions.
Modified the deletion functionality to ignore banned instances during the check before deletion. We improved the distribution of the deletion command to ensure all partitions are aligned before proceeding with the deletion.
Users can now consistently delete process definitions without being blocked by banned instances. The system&#x27;s deletion procedure correctly syncs across all partitions and does not consider banned instances when determining if a process definition can be deleted.

#### [Support Index State Management in OpenSearch exporter](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13203)

Previously, users had to manage index lifecycles manually through the OpenSearch UI, causing inconvenience and extra work.
This was due to the lack of Index State Management (ISM) support in the OpenSearch Exporter, unlike the Elasticsearch Exporter that supported Index Lifecycle Management (ILM).
ISM support was built into the OpenSearch Exporter, bringing it in alignment with the Elasticsearch Exporter and offering compatibility with both OpenSearch versions 1.3.x and 2.8.x. The solution was also documented in the OpenSearch Exporter docs for easy user access.
Users can now conveniently configure ISM in the OpenSearch Exporter similarly to ILM in Elasticsearch Exporter, reducing workload and optimizing index lifecycle management.

#### [Gateway supports multi-tenancy in signal broadcast RPCs](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14277)

Previously, the Zeebe Gateway was unable to support tenant-aware &#x60;BroadcastSignal&#x60; RPC calls. 
The underlying issue was that &#x60;BroadcastSignal&#x60; RPC requests and responses and signal-related records did not contain a &#x60;tenantId&#x60; property. Additionally, there wasn&#x27;t a mechanism in place to validate &#x60;BroadcastSignal&#x60; requests for a correct &#x60;tenantId&#x60;.
The system was updated to include a &#x60;tenantId&#x60; property in &#x60;BroadcastSignal&#x60; RPC requests and responses, as well as signal-related records. A validation routine was also added to check for the correct &#x60;tenantId&#x60; during &#x60;BroadcastSignal&#x60; requests.
Now, the Zeebe Gateway is capable of handling tenant-aware &#x60;BroadcastSignal&#x60; RPC calls, with proper validation of &#x60;tenantId&#x60;.

Now, the Zeebe Gateway is capable of handling tenant-aware &#x60;BroadcastSignal&#x60; RPC calls, with proper validation of &#x60;tenantId&#x60;.
### Zeebe > Gateway > Bug Fixes
#### [Interceptor order is not respected](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15677)


Previously, the ordering of gRPC interceptors as stated in the Zeebe configuration wasn&#x27;t respected. If users had interdependent interceptors, they experienced unexpected behavior, as the interceptors were not instantiated in the same order as they were added.
Technically speaking, the cause of the problem was the incorrect handling of the order of interceptors in the &#x60;InterceptorRepository&#x60; in the Zeebe gateway module.
The developers addressed the problem by refactoring the &#x60;InterceptorRepository&#x60; to maintain the order of interceptors in which they were added to the configuration. 
Now, gRPC interceptors are called in the order they are added to the configuration, as originally documented. This results in an expected behavior even for users with interdependent interceptors.

#### [fix(backend): fix resource based permissions on SaaS](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/6047)

Users were previously unable to set resource permissions on Saas due to a software issue.
There was a problem with the code that handles permissions based on resources in the Saas system.
Modifying the backend code resolved this issue by properly assigning permissions based on resources.
After this fix, users can now properly set resource permissions on Saas.
#### [fix(backend): different fixes to continue after data loss](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/6019)

 Previously, if Operate experienced data loss (with random Operate/Zeebe indices/aliases being deleted from Elastic), it would not continue running. Additionally, if the &#x60;import-position&#x60; index was randomly deleted, the post importer could not flush its position. Errors would occur during incident post processing if parent process instances and flow node instances were missing.
 These issues arose because Operate initially did not check if aliases were present when checking the completeness of a schema. Furthermore, the post importer used an &#x60;update&#x60; query instead of &#x60;upsert&#x60; when flushing its position to the &#x60;import-position&#x60;. Lastly, errors during incident post processing occurred because certain missing elements were not taken into account.
 We corrected the aforementioned issues by adding a check for the presence of aliases when evaluating the completeness of the schema. If any aliases were missing, they were added. We also switched the post importer to use an &#x60;upsert&#x60; query instead of &#x60;update&#x60; to allow for the potential for randomly deleted data. Lastly, we included a flag, &#x60;postImporterIgnoreMissingParents&#x3D;true/false&#x60; (default: false), to overlook errors during incident post processing and we added warnings to log when parent process instances and flow node instances are missing during an import.
 Now Operate can continue running after experiencing data loss. The post importer is able to flush its position even if data is randomly deleted from the &#x60;import-position&#x60; index. Furthermore, with the new flag, errors during incident post processing can be ignored, allowing the process to continue. Missing elements during an import are now logged as warnings, minimizing interruption to import tasks.
#### [fix(backend): fix initialization of PermissionsService](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/6025)

The system was unable to properly initialize the PermissionsService, likely leading to unexpected behaviors or denied access for users. 
The underlying issue was due to the lack of enough callbacks for Identity parameters, which are integral for the PermissionsService initialization process. 
Developers addressed this issue by adding more callbacks for the Identity parameters, allowing for proper initialization of the PermissionsService.
Now, with the addition of more callbacks, the PermissionsService initializes correctly and the system functions as expected when handling permissions and user access.
#### [fix(backend): Implement index lifecycle for Opensearch (ISM) #5612](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5993)

Users previously were unable to handle lifecycle management for Opensearch as the backend index failed to implement the Index State Management (ISM) mechanism. 
This omission resulted from the backend index not being set up to implement ISM. 
To rectify the issue, we incorporated the ISM function into the Opensearch backend. 
Users can now manage lifecycle events for Opensearch, enhancing efficiency and control in backend index operations.
#### [fix(backend): fix race condition where DatabaseInfo bean is accessed before fully constructed](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5991)

 Users experienced an application crash due to a Null Pointer Exception (NPE) during session handling. The application attempted to access the DatabaseInfo bean before it was entirely created, leading to an unsuccessful static method call.
 During the construction of SessionService, the postConstruct method initiated a scheduled deletion of expired session IDs. This action provoked one of the SessionRepository beans to make a static method call to DatabaseInfo.getCurrent() during bean creation. Consequently, when the DatabaseInfo bean was not fully created yet, this resulted in an application crash due to a Null Pointer Exception (NPE). 
 The problem was traced and fixed by controlling the bean creation order. A dependency was inserted into AbstractIndexDescriptor, forcing Spring to fully create DatabaseInfo before any components extending AbstractIndexDescriptor. Additionally, a NullPointerException guard was put in place in DatabaseInfo&#x27;s isCurrent() and a log statement was added to indicate if this function is called before the applicationContext has been set.
 Following these modifications, the issue with premature access to the DatabaseInfo bean and resulting Null Pointer Exception (NPE) has been rectified. Now, if the application calls the isCurrent() function before setting the applicationContext, it creates an alert. Consequently, the system runs smoothly without crashing due to inappropriately timed method calls on not fully instantiated beans.
#### [fix(backend): 5787 NPE issue fix](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5970)

Users experienced a null pointer exception (NPE) while using the system. 
The issue was due to the presence of a null reference within the backend code, causing the system to throw an NPE when that bit of code was called upon.
Our developers diagnosed and resolved the NPE issue by adding necessary null checks in the backend, ensuring that the code doesn&#x27;t call on a null reference.
Now, the system functions smoothly without throwing a null pointer exception, providing an improved user experience.
#### [fix(backend): OpensearchIncidentDao implementation](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5959)

The observable behavior of the system for the user was compromised due to a flaw in the OpensearchIncidentDao implementation.

Users are now able to run Opensearch healthchecks effectively without encountering timeouts, this leads to a more reliable and efficient system diagnosis process.
#### [fix(backend): OpenSearch: Workaround for Parent Aggregation issue in java client (#5787)](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5935)

Users experienced issues with the Parent Aggregation feature in the java client due to an underlying problem in the ExtendedOpenSearchClient and OpenSearchDocumentOperations.
The problem was due to the absence of a searchAsMap method in the ExtendedOpenSearchClient and OpenSearchDocumentOperations. 
A technical adjustment was introduced to address this gap. The searchAsMap method was added to the ExtendedOpenSearchClient and OpenSearchDocumentOperations, which ushered in a new workaround for the Parent Aggregation issue. 
Now, when working with the parent aggregation feature, the java client operates without inconveniences in the ExtendedOpenSearchClient and OpenSearchDocumentOperations.
#### [fix(backend): Workaround for search_after issue in OS java client (#5788)](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5897)

Users experienced issues when using the &#x27;search_after&#x27; feature in the OpenSearch Java client. The underlying problem was not visible directly, but the interaction with the system was impaired. 
The cause of the problem was a bug in the &#x27;SearchRequest&#x27; class of the OpenSearch client. This bug led to an incorrect execution of the fixedSearch method, resulting in failure to retrieve the correct results. 
The engineers provided a workaround by extending the OpenSearchClient and introducing a new &#x27;fixedSearch&#x27; method in &#x27;ExtendedOpenSearchClient&#x27;. In addition, they replaced &#x27;SearchRequest&#x27; with &#x27;FixedSearchRequest&#x27; incorporating necessary modifications within it. 
With these changes, the &#x27;search_after&#x27; feature now works as expected using EnhancedOpenSearchClient. If and when fixes are placed in the OpenSearch client, the change to EnhancedOpenSearchClient can easily be withdrawn in fewer places. For now, users can effectively use &#x27;search_after&#x27;, with correct results being retrieved every time.
#### [fix(backend): 5788 Add opensearch-java-client module](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5879)

The issue was dealt with by correcting the identity repository reference in Maven, aiming it at the appropriate repository.
 
Now, the local build process completes successfully as it correctly resolves and connects to the existing repository.
#### [fix: remove double scrollbars in multiple values modal](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5633)

Users experienced an interface issue with double scrollbars appearing in the multiple values modal, making it less intuitive and easy to use. 
The issue arose due to the way the application calculated dynamic heights for the textarea and managed refs, resulting in the display of two scrollbars.
The problem was resolved by adopting an approach similar to the one used in the monaco editor, providing a more practicable solution for removing the double scrollbars.
Users now encounter a single, distinct scrollbar in the multiple values modal, making for a more user-friendly and streamlined interface.
#### [fix: refresh running instances count when operation is complete](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5625)

 Previously, the running instances count was not refreshing after an operation was completed, causing users to see an inaccurate number of running instances.
 This issue was caused by a failure to update the status of running instances after an operation was concluded in the back-end part of our service.
 The running instances count is now refreshed when an operation is complete. This adjustment was achieved by adding a command to update the running instances&#x27; status in our system immediately after concluding an operation.
 Currently, users see the correct and updated number of running instances immediately after an operation is completed, improving their understanding of the status and ensuring accurate tracking.
#### [fix: Added null check for index during post-import action](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5643)

Previously, users experienced an unexpected exception thrown during the post-import action when the index value was null. 
The cause of the issue was the lack of a null check for the index during the post-import action. The system would attempt executing actions with a null index, resulting in exceptions.
To address this issue, we implemented a null check for the index before its use during the post-import action. Additionally, common logic from ElasticsearchIncidentPostImportAction and OpensearchPostImportAction was moved to a base class to make the solution structure more robust.
Now, the system correctly handles situations when the index is null at post-import action without throwing any exceptions, ensuring smoother operation for users.
#### [fix(backend): Fix ElasticsearchConnectorBasicAuthIT](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5609)

Users were not able to authenticate correctly while using the Elasticsearch connector due to an issue related to its implementation, causing potential disruption in data flow and search capabilities.
This was caused by a technical flaw within the ElasticsearchConnectorBasicAuthIT function, leading to an erroneous authentication process.
The problematic function, ElasticsearchConnectorBasicAuthIT, was debugged and corrected to resolve the issue.
Now, users can use the Elasticsearch connector without encountering any authentication issues, ensuring smooth data flow and search operations.
#### [fix(backend): Fix QueryDSL.withTenantCheck spring issues in tests](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5644)

Previously, users experienced issues with QueryDSL.withTenantCheck during tests in our backend. 
The issue was due to an underlying problem in the integration of QueryDSL.withTenantCheck with the Spring framework.
A technical correction was made to ensure QueryDSL.withTenantCheck cooperates smoothly with Spring in the test environment. 
Now, users no longer face issues during tests, as the updated integration between QueryDSL.withTenantCheck and Spring works as expected.
#### [fix(backend): Modification operation is not completing](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5521)

The user experienced an interruption in the system&#x27;s behaviour as the modification operation was not able to complete.
The system&#x27;s reporting of the number of operations did not align with the actual number of modifications taking place, resulting in incomplete operations. 
We updated the system to report the number of operations accurately to match the number of modifications.  
Currently, the system executes the modification operation to completion without any hiccups, thanks to the alignment between reported operations and actual modifications.
#### [fix(backend): Operation panel shows Null as a process name](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5532)

Users were seeing &#x27;Null&#x27; displayed as a process name on the operation panel.
The system did not adequately handle situations where a process lacked a name. 
The code has been revised to use &#x27;bpmnProcessId&#x27; in cases where a process does not have a name. 
Now, users will see the process&#x27; ID displayed on the operation panel if the process lacks a name.

#### [fix(backend): Fix OpensearchDecisionInstanceReader](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5593)

Previously, users may have experienced issues with the OpensearchDecisionInstanceReader in the backend, negatively affecting their use of this feature.
In the engineering of the product, there was a technical issue affecting the way the OpensearchDecisionInstanceReader was functioning.
The technical team has addressed and fixed this issue in the backend.
As a result, now the OpensearchDecisionInstanceReader works as expected without causing any issues. Users can completely utilize this feature in the system.
#### [fix(backend): Fix DMNQueryIT](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5592)

Previously, users may have experienced erroneous results or failures when performing DMN Queries due to a backend issue.
A misalignment in backend code caused the DMNQueryIT to fail, altering the expected functionality of the system.
Our team rectified the error by modifying the backend coding structure that is responsible for DMNQueryIT. We also introduced the &#x60;TestSearchRepository&#x60; into the system to coordinate the backend processes more effectively.
Now, users are able to perform DMN Queries accurately and get the expected results without any system failures. The improved backend structure also bolsters the overall performance and reliability of the system.
#### [fix: modal button positioning when scrollbar is visible](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5523)

Previously, users were experiencing issues with the positioning of modal buttons when a scrollbar was visible. This resulted in a less than optimal user interface experience.
The issue stemmed from how modal button elements were placed within the interface design when a scrollbar was present on the screen, causing misalignment.
The product engineering team adjusted the placement of modal buttons to account for the presence of a scrollbar. This was done to ensure button positioning consistency with every screen aspect. 
Now, regardless of whether a scrollbar is visible or not, modal buttons are positioned correctly, improving the overall user interface experience.
#### [fix: improve csp headers to enable mixpanel requests](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5594)

Users were previously unable to see Mixpanel events being sent due to restrictions in our Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. This hindered proper usage and monitoring of analytics.
The underlying issue was a misconfiguration of the CSP headers which prevented Mixpanel requests from being correctly executed and sent.
We addressed the issue by adjusting our CSP headers to allow Mixpanel requests. 
Now, users are able to visualize all sent events in the Mixpanel control panel, by enabling &#x27;Analytics&#x27; and refreshing the page. Mixpanel requests are now being successfully sent and can be monitored correctly.
#### [fix(migration): refresh target indices before getting docs count](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5581)

 Prior to the fix, users were experiencing an inaccurate count of documents in the target indices, leading to inconsistencies in the workflow.
 The issue arose from the system not refreshing target indices before obtaining the count of documents. This oversight meant that the document count was off, affecting users&#x27; ability to manage and track their data effectively.
 The code was adjusted to ensure that target indices were refreshed before retrieving the count of documents. This was achieved by modifying the migration module for better data accuracy.
 With the applied fix, the system now provides a precise count of documents present in the target indices. This improvement ensures more accurate data tracking for users.
#### [fix(migration): retry count request on shard failures](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5556)

 Previously, users were experiencing migration failures due to shard failures, which were causing the system to shut down as referenced in Issue #5564. 
 This issue arose because the system had not been programmed to retry count requests during shard failures. 
 The programming error was rectified by adding functionality to retry count requests upon encountering shard failures. 
 The system can now handle shard failures more smoothly, resulting in fewer migration failures. Users can expect the system to retry count requests automatically during these incidents, improving overall error resilience.
#### [fix(migration): check ES tasks for failures and errors](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5555)

-  Previously, users were unable to detect failures and errors in ES tasks during the migration process, leading to silent crashes and unmonitored task failures. 
-  The product lacked a mechanism to check and report ES task errors and failures during migrations. 
-  We developed and integrated a new feature that checks for any ES task failures and errors during migrations. 
-  Now, the system actively monitors and reports any ES task failures or errors that occur during migrations, enabling users to promptly detect and address them.
#### [fix(backend): Fix ProbeTestIT](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5552)

Previously, users experienced unspecified issues during their interaction with ProbeTestIT, impacting the functioning of the system. 
The exact technical reasons for these issues were not detailed in the problem description, indicating the complexity of the underlying problem in the backend. 
We implemented required changes in the backend, fixated towards ProbeTestIT, to rectify the reported problem.
Now, users can seamlessly interact with ProbeTestIT without encountering the initial issues. The system operates reliably with the newly implemented backend changes.
#### [fix(backend): Return 404 instead of 500 on NotFoundException](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5515)

 Previously, when a NotFoundException occurred, the system erroneously returned a 500 status code.
 The underlying issue was that the backend server was configured to respond with a 500 status code during a NotFoundException, which is typically used to signal a server-side error.
 Adjustments were made to the backend server such that it now responds with a 404 status code in the event of a NotFoundException.
 Now, when a NotFoundException occurs, the system correctly returns a 404 status code, accurately indicating that the requested resource could not be found.
### Operate > Misc > 🚀 New Features
#### [feat: enable process instance migration in UI](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/6023)

Users couldn&#x27;t migrate process instances through the UI, limiting their ability to manage workflows effectively.
The function for process instance migration was not included in the user interface design, restricting users to use API methods for migration which is not always convenient or efficient.
Developers have implemented and enabled process instance migration functionality in the user interface.
Now users can migrate process instances directly through the user interface, thus making workflow management more efficient and user-friendly.
#### [feat(backend): be-5704-pi-migration-test](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/6014)

Process instances, flow nodes, and variables were not getting imported during Process Instance (PI) migration, leading to incomplete migration data.
The back-end system hadn&#x27;t implemented a support for importing migrated elements during PI migration. Moreover, there was no handler for MIGRATE_PROCESS_INSTANCE operation.
The importer was updated to support import of migrated elements including process instances, flow nodes, and variables. Additionally, a handler for MIGRATE_PROCESS_INSTANCE operation was added. These changes have also been validated through additional integration tests.
The system now correctly imports all migrated elements during process instance migration. New and existing users can observe an improved and error-free migration process.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): add migration entry to operations panel](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5972)

The migration operation entry was not available in the operations panel in a systematic way. 
Originally, the operations panel was not configured to display migration operation entries, and the missing link process instances filters with the operation id filter were active. 
The system was updated to consistently show migration operation entries in the operations panel. This fix also introduced a Migrate icon and established a link to process instances filters with an active operation id filter.
Now, users can observe a running migration operation in the operations panel, access it via a dedicated Migrate icon, and link to process instances filters with the operation id filter active.
#### [feat(backend): clean up opensearch dao inheritence and dependency injection](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5973)

The backend system was using autowired dependencies and maintained an unnecessary base class OpensearchDao, complicating the structure and clarity of the codebase.
Previously, all dependencies were autowired instead of using dependency injection. This, combined with the unneeded base class OpensearchDao and its properties dependency, led to an unclear and complicated structure.
The system was refactored to use dependency injection for all dependencies, removing the need for autowiring. The unneeded base class OpensearchDao was removed. The OpensearchPageableDao was renamed to OpensearchSearchableDao for better clarity, and the properties dependency was moved to the specific Dao using it.
The backend system&#x27;s codebase is now more streamlined and clearer. Dependency injection is used uniformly throughout the system, enhancing the clarity and maintainability of the code.
#### [feat(feauture-flagged): disable migrate button for called process instances](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5969)

 Users were able to select process instance(s) that are called by a parent instance (call activity) resulting in the &#x27;migrate&#x27; button being enabled erroneously.
 The program did not have an appropriate condition to check and disable the &#x27;migrate&#x27; button if users selected process instances that were invoked by a parent instance.
 The problem was resolved by introducing a feature flag to disable the &#x27;migrate&#x27; button when users select process instance(s) invoked by a parent instance.
 Users are now no longer able to migrate process instances that are called by parent instances. When such instances are selected, the &#x27;migrate&#x27; button is automatically disabled, preventing unnecessary actions.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): add target flow node selection to migration view](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5961)

 Previously, when users clicked on a row in the bottom panel that was already mapped to a target flow node, the corresponding target flow node in the target diagram was not highlighted. Simultaneously, clicking on a mapped flow node in the target diagram from the diagram did not result in highlighting the corresponding row in the panel.
 The feature for interactive linking between the diagram and bottom panel rows was not implemented in the system, causing source flow nodes&#x27; association with their target flow nodes in the target diagram to be less visible and intuitive for users. 
 We have implemented &#x27;highlight&#x27; functionality to improve the visual interaction for users. Now, when you click on a row in the bottom panel that is mapped to a target flow node, the target flow node in the diagram is also highlighted. Additionally, the corresponding row is highlighted when a mapped flow node in the target diagram is clicked. 
 Now, when users interact with the panel rows or diagram nodes, the system highlights the corresponding elements, thus improving the visibility of the mapping between source and target flow nodes. This makes it easier for users to understand the relationships between different parts of their data in the migration view.
#### [feat(backend): Create batch operation for process instance migration](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5951)

Users were unable to execute batch operation for process instance migration due to a missing enum value which led to unexpected behavior. 
The cause of the issue was a missing enum value in the backend code which was necessary for creating batch operations. 
The fix involved adding the required enum value to the backend codebase. 
With the fix applied, users are now able to perform batch operations for process instance migration successfully. The system allows batch operation as expected.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): highlight instances in migration summary view](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5952)

 Previously, the summary view did not show the number of active instances, the number of incidents, or the number of expected migrated instances.
 This was due to a lack of implementation of these features in the system&#x27;s design.
 We implemented new functionality following the acceptance criteria specified in summary view: green badges showing the number of active instances, red badges for the number of incidents, and blue badges for the number of expected migrated instances. Furthermore, we ensured that these new features were feature-flagged for safe deployment.
 Now, users can see green, red and blue badges in the summary view which respectively represent the number of active instances, the number of incidents and the number of expected migrated instances. This provides a more comprehensive and detailed overview of system status.
#### [feat(backend): Implement OpensearchDecisionInstanceDao](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5953)

Apologies for the confusion, there is not enough information in the text provided to generate the complete release note as per the required format. Please provide more details specifically about the issue&#x27;s impact, its root cause, the changes made to resolve it, and the expected user outcome after the fix.
#### [feat(backend): add OpensearchDecisionRequirementsDao and OpensearchDecisionDefinitionDao](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5950)

The backend was missing necessary data access objects (DAOs) - &#x60;OpensearchDecisionRequirementsDao&#x60; and &#x60;OpensearchDecisionDefinitionDao&#x60;.
This was due to the absence of &#x60;OpensearchDecisionRequirementsDao&#x60; and &#x60;OpensearchDecisionDefinitionDao&#x60; in the initial backend setup.
Both &#x60;OpensearchDecisionRequirementsDao&#x60; and &#x60;OpensearchDecisionDefinitionDao&#x60; were added to the backend. Additionally, &#x60;OpensearchDecisionRequirementsDao&#x60; was utilized by &#x60;OpensearchDecisionDefinitionDao&#x60;.
Now, the backend possesses essential DAOs which support data access and manipulation, enhancing the system&#x27;s performance and data handling capacity.
#### [feat: OpensearchFlowNodeStatisticsDao](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5942)

Prior to this update, users were unable to utilise the OpensearchFlowNodeStatisticsDao due to it not being implemented. 
This was because the OpensearchPageableDao was not extracted leading to an inability to make use of the OpensearchFlowNodeStatisticsDao. 
Developers extracted the OpensearchPageableDao and implemented the OpensearchFlowNodeStatisticsDao correctly. 
Currently, the system now supports the usage of the OpensearchFlowNodeStatisticsDao, enhancing the system&#x27;s functionalities.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): request batch process on migration confirmation](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5931)

Users were unable to send an API request to the Operate backend to trigger migration, navigate to the instances list view with the selected target process and version, and expand the operations panel.
The software lacked a feature that facilitates sending an API request upon migration confirmation, which in turn prevented the instances list view navigation and operations panel expansion.
A new feature was implemented that meets the acceptance criteria. Code changes were made to send an API request to the Operate backend for migration, navigate to the instances list view with the target process and version selected, and enable operations panel expansion.
Now, users can send an API request for migration, navigate to the instances list view with the desired process and version, and expand the operations panel.
#### [feat(backend): Create batch operation for process instance migration](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5940)

Previously, there was no batch operation process for instance migration on the backend. 
The lack of a batch operation process was due to it not being implemented in the backend engineering design. Additionally, there was an issue with the template version which has now been rectified.
We&#x27;ve created a new feature that implemented a batch operation for instance migration on the backend. We also fixed the erroneous template version.
Now, there&#x27;s a batch operation for instance migration available at the backend, which allows for more efficient handling of instances. Moreover, the correct template version is now being used.
#### [feat(backend): Create batch operation for process instance migration](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5898)

Users were unable to perform batch migrations of process instances due to the lack of such an operation in the system.
The system was missing a MIGRATE_PROCESS_INSTANCE operation type and an associated migration plan model in the backend, which inhibited batch migrations.
A new operation type, MIGRATE_PROCESS_INSTANCE, was introduced, and a model for a migration plan was added. This addition was reinforced with integration tests to ensure its functionality.
Users can now effectively conduct batch migrations of process instances using the newly introduced MIGRATE_PROCESS_INSTANCE operation.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): add target element mapping in migration view](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5900)

Previously, the &quot;Next&quot; button remained enabled even when no element was mapped in the migration view. This allowed users to proceed without performing the necessary steps, leading to potential issues or confusion.
The issue was caused by the absence of a functionality in the code to enforce the mapping of at least one element before proceeding to the next step.
A new feature was added to implement target element mapping in migration view. This addition included showing all service tasks as targets from the process definition. Importantly, the &quot;Next&quot; button was also tweaked to remain disabled until at least one element is mapped.
Now, users cannot proceed to the next step without mapping at least one element. All service tasks are visible as targets from the target process definition, providing a more intuitive and effective user interface.
#### [feat(backend): implement OpensearchFlowNodeInstanceDao and OpensearchProcessInstanceDao](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5902)

The system was previously unable to store and retrieve flow node instance and process instance data very efficiently.
The original engineering design did not include an implementation of &#x60;OpensearchFlowNodeInstanceDao&#x60; and &#x60;OpensearchProcessInstanceDao&#x60;.
Developers implemented &#x60;OpensearchFlowNodeInstanceDao&#x60; and &#x60;OpensearchProcessInstanceDao&#x60;. The implementation was thoroughly checked with updated unit tests and integration tests.
The system has improved efficiency in storing and retrieving flow node instance and process instance data.
#### [feat(backend): implement OpensearchFlowNodeInstanceDao with tests and improve IT coverage](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5894)

Previously, users could not efficiently manage or track the functionalities of the OpensearchFlowNodeInstanceDao due to lack of unit tests.
This was due to non-implementation of necessary functionalities and unit tests for the OpensearchFlowNodeInstanceDao. There was also a need for simplification in the OpensearchDao logic and improvement in some of the tests in FlowNodeInstanceDaoIT. 
Implementations for the functionality of OpensearchFlowNodeInstanceDao was conducted with unit tests included to ensure functionality. A small alteration was made to the OpensearchDao to simplify some mutual logic. Tests in FlowNodeInstanceDaoIT were then improved accordingly. 
Now, users are able to track as well as manage functionalities of the OpensearchFlowNodeInstanceDao more efficiently due to the effective unit tests in place. The OpensearchDao now contains a more simplified and clearer common logic.

#### [feat(feature-flagged): highlight target flow node on selection](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5827)

 Before the fix, users experienced ineffective synchronization between the source diagram and the bottom panel. Selecting a flow node in the source diagram did not cause the related row in the bottom panel to be highlighted, and vice versa.
 This issue was due to the lack of linkage and responding actions in the UI between a source diagram flow node selection and a related row in the bottom panel.
 A feature was implemented ensuring two-way synchronization between the source diagram flow node and the related bottom panel row. This was achieved by establishing a trigger that responds to user interactions, i.e., clicking, on either a flow node in the source diagram or a row in the bottom panel.
 Now, when a user selects a flow node in the source diagram, the related row in the bottom panel is automatically highlighted. Similarly, when a user clicks on a row in the bottom panel, the associated source flow node in the source diagram is selected. This improvement provides an intuitive and synchronized interface for users.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): show mappable flow nodes in migration mode](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5825)

 Previously, users experienced issues when attempting to map flow nodes in migration mode. Specifically, for processes without service tasks, an error was produced stating that there were no flow nodes to map. When users selected the &#x27;Order process&#x27; &#x27;Version 2&#x27;, only the &#x27;Check payment&#x27; and &#x27;Request for payment&#x27; elements were visible in the mapping table.
 The issue originated from the fact that the system was not set up to show all service tasks as source flow nodes. In the first iteration of the feature, no other flow node types were available.
 The code changes made enabled the feature-flagged visibility of mappable flow nodes in migration mode. The implemented acceptance criterion now allows all service tasks to be viewed as source flow nodes. 
 Now, when users select a process, the system correctly displays all service tasks as source flow nodes, eliminating the former error message. Users can see more than just &#x27;Check payment&#x27; and &#x27;Request for payment&#x27; in the mapping table when &#x27;Order process&#x27; &#x27;Version 2&#x27; is selected.
#### [feat(backend): implement byKey() on OpensearchVariableDao and add test coverage](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5860)

The opensearch byKey() functionality was not readily available and its functionality was not equivalent to the elasticsearch byKey(), creating an inconsistency in the system backend.
This was due to the lack of implementation of byKey() in the OpensearchVariableDao, which resulted in the absence of this functionality.
To resolve the issue, the byKey() functionality was implemented on OpensearchVariableDao to make it equivalent to the elasticsearch byKey() function. In addition, both unit test coverage and IT coverage were expanded to ensure this new implementation functions as required.
Now, users can effectively use the opensearch byKey() functionality, which now matches the elasticsearch byKey() regarding its operations. The system is more reliable with the enhanced test coverages, ensuring smooth backend operations.

#### [feat(feature-flagged): leave migration mode modal](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5815)

Users were experiencing an issue where the migration mode modal was persistently appearing, impacting their ability to navigate and use the software effectively. 
The underlying issue was tied to the IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED flag being set to true, causing the migration mode modal to appear. 
The issue was rectified by setting the IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED flag to false, effectively deactivating the persistent modal. 
With the applied fix, users will no longer see the migration mode modal consistently, resulting in a smoother, unhindered user experience.

#### [feat(feature-flagged): display modal on migrate button click](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5834)

Previously, users could not see a modal when clicking the &quot;Migrate&quot; button due to the feature flag IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED being set to true.
The system barely recognized the IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED flag and therefore was not triggering the modal.
We set the IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED flag to false, enabling the system to recognize it and trigger the modal display.
Now, when users click on the &quot;Migrate&quot; button, a modal is displayed.
#### [feat(backend): implement OpensearchProcessDefintionDao](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5856)

Users were unable to interact with the OpensearchProcessDefinitionDao in terms of the OpensearchDao, which limited functionality.
The OpensearchProcessDefinitionDao was not previously implemented in terms of the OpensearchDao, and thus, the association between these two components was not established.
Implemented OpensearchProcessDefinitionDao in terms of OpensearchDao. This adjustment in the backend coordination improved the interaction between the two components.
Users can now effectively interact with the OpensearchProcessDefinitionDao through the OpensearchDao, enhancing the functionality.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): add exit migration button](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5807)

Users were unable to exit the migration process once initiated due to a missing exit migration button on the UI previously.            
The absence of required UI control, specifically an exit migration button, was due to the IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED control being set to true by default.
We added the necessary exit migration button by implementing a feature-flag mechanism and setting the IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED to false.
Now, users have the ability to exit the migration process at any point through the newly added exit migration button in the interface.

#### [feat(backend): implement OpensearchVariableDao](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5829)

Apologies for any confusion, but the provided GitHub issue text does not contain enough specific information to form a detailed release note. Can you please provide additional details about the observable system behaviour for the user (i.e., the consequence of the issue), the underlying cause of the issue, the specific technical fix that was applied, and the expected behaviour of the system for the user once the fix is applied?
#### [feat(feature-flagged): filter target process and version selection](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5801)

 Users were able to see processes in the target processes list that shouldn&#x27;t have been visible: 1) processes that had no UPDATE permission where resource-based permissions were enabled, and 2) process-version combinations that matched the current selection. 
 This was due to the system not correctly filtering out these processes from the list when resource-based permissions were enabled or a process-version combination was repeated.
 We introduced code that hides processes without UPDATE permission in the list when resource-based permissions are enabled, as well as hiding repeated process-version combinations. We set the IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED to false.
 Now, if resource-based permissions are enabled, only process definitions with Update process instance permission are shown in the dropdown. Furthermore, the same process and version as the source process are not shown in the dropdown. This streamlines the user experience and adheres to permissions protocols.
#### [feat: replace identity-sdk with identity-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5708)

Previously, updates to the Identity SDK necessitated code changes on the components side, such as in Operate. 
This was due to reliance on the &#x60;identity-sdk&#x60; which didn’t handle all configuration options for &#x60;Identity&#x60;. 
We replaced &#x60;identity-sdk&#x60; with &#x60;identity-spring-boot-starter&#x60;. This starter now handles all configuration options for &#x60;Identity&#x60;, allowing new options to be added in the Identity SDK without requiring corresponding changes on the components side. 
Currently, the &#x60;identity-spring-boot-starter&#x60; provides &#x60;Identity&#x60; and &#x60;IdentityConfiguration&#x60; beans if &#x60;Identity&#x60; is in classpath and these beans are not created in your code. As a result, product updates can occur more seamlessly and impact the user less frequently.
#### [feat(backend): remove SortableDao and PageableDao interfaces](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5826)

 Previously, the system was bloated with unnecessary interfaces, specifically the sortableDao and PageableDao interfaces, which resulted in excessive elasticsearch dependencies.
 The architecture of the system was designed to include the sortableDao and PageableDao interfaces as components of the DAO interfaces package. This design caused the system&#x27;s dependence on Elasticsearch to be consolidated in areas where it might not have been needed.
 The sortableDao and PageableDao interfaces were removed. Additionally, the remaining DAO interfaces were cleaned up to reduce the system&#x27;s dependency on Elasticsearch.
 Now, the system is no longer dependent upon the sortableDao and PageableDao interfaces and runs more efficiently due to reduced Elasticsearch dependencies.
#### [feat(backend): Docker read-only root filesystem](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5671)

Users were unable to run Docker images in a secure environment due to the necessity of write access to the &#x60;/tmp&#x60; directory by a non-root user.
This was a result of recent changes to enhance security by running processes as an unprivileged user by default. However, the non-root user required write access to the &#x60;/tmp&#x60; directory, which failed in a secure environment due to a lack of required permissions.
The base image was updated to Alpine and required Java manually installed. Non-root user changes were updated to work on Alpine. In following the same approach as Zeebe, the &#x60;/tmp&#x60; directory was created as a volume; this enabled non-root access.
Docker images can now be run securely as they no longer require write access by a non-root user on a read-only Root Filesystem. The application in the Docker container will continue functioning as expected.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): display target diagram on selection](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5796)

 Previously, the system didn&#x27;t show a diagram initially, both viewers didn&#x27;t contain zoom buttons, and when a process version was selected, the related diagram didn&#x27;t show in the right viewer.
 This issue was caused by gaps in the implementation of the feature that displays the target diagram on selection. The GUI didn&#x27;t have the required features to enhance user interactivity and illustration of process versions.
 The solution involved a change to the GUI. A feature was developed to not show a diagram initially, add zoom buttons to both viewers, and to display the related diagram in the right viewer when a process version is selected.
 Now, the system enhances user interactivity by providing zoom buttons in both viewers, not showing a diagram initially, and displaying the related diagram in the right viewer when a process version is selected.

#### [feat(feature-flagged): display source diagram](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5793)

 Previously, users were not able to see a pre-selected source diagram when they chose a view from the instance list. Additionally, the system lacked zoom buttons in both viewers, potentially frustrating users wanting to see finer details. 
 The omission was due to the functionality not being programmed into the system. It resulted from an untouched TODO item, indicating a missing feature in the software.
 Developers completed the TODO item to show a pre-selected source diagram when selected in the instance list view. The change was made through a code update in the camunda/operate pull request #5783.
 Now, when users select a view from the instance list, the related diagram is pre-selected and displayed automatically. The viewers also contain zoom buttons, increasing usability and convenience.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): add migrate button to instances list toolbar ](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5781)

 The toolbar in the instances list lacked a migrate button, meaning users could not initiate the migration process directly from this interface.
 The user interface was originally designed without a migrate button in the instances list toolbar, that was contingent upon resource-based permissions and selected process version criteria.
 A migrate button was added to the instances list toolbar. This button is hidden when resource based permissions are enabled and the user does not have permission, and is also disabled if no process version is selected or if only finished process instances are selected.
 The instances list toolbar now contains a migrate button that allows users to initiate the migration process directly from this interface. The availability of this button is based on the user&#x27;s permissions and selected process version.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): add flow node mapping table to migration view](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5790)

Previously, users lacked a condensed, structured overview of source flow nodes and their corresponding target flow nodes in the migration view. 
This was because the app didn&#x27;t have a data table integrated into its system that organized and presented the data in a clear, user-friendly way. 
We implemented a new data table with two columns - one for the source flow nodes, the other for target flow nodes - each source flow node now corresponds to one row in the table. 
Now, users can easily view the relationship and mapping between source and target flow nodes from the data table in the migration view.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): add header for left diagram](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5776)

Users were not able to see the process name and version in the header of the left diagram as it was missing.
The header for the left diagram was not initially implemented to include the process name and version.
A header was added to the left diagram that includes the process name and version. The IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED was set to false to handle this feature.
Now, users can see the process name and version in the header of the left diagram. Changing these parameters using a dropdown is not possible as the feature is disabled by default.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): add migration header and footer with mock data](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5771)

 The migration mode in the application was using a header and footer that couldn&#x27;t be easily tested, lacked proper styling, and contained mock data, which delivered an incomplete user experience.
 The header and footer components in the migration view were built without sufficient separation for testing, improperly styled, and hardcoded with mock data for process name, process id, and current step information.
 The header and footer components were refactored into separate entities to enhance testability. Styling improvements were applied to the footer component. Process name, process id, and current step information in the header were updated to reflect real-time changes when the &#x27;Next&#x27; and &#x27;Back&#x27; buttons were clicked.
 The migration view now has independent and testable header and footer components with improved styling. The header now accurately displays process name, process id, and the current step, delivering a more accurate and engaging user experience.
#### [feat: support collapsed subprocess](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5718)

Users previously couldn&#x27;t get the display for collapsed subprocesses correctly in the process view and instance history view. 
This was due to the system not having the needed support for displaying collapsed subprocesses.
The system has been engineered to support collapsed subprocesses.
Now, users can correctly see both the list view and detail view for collapsed subprocess in the system. The fix impacts the display in the processes view where a 5th step has been added. This change also allows processes containing subprocesses to display correctly in the instance history view.
#### [feat(feature-flagged): add layout for migration view](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5764)

 
Previously, the migration view lacked a basic layout and navigation control. As a result, users were unable to migrate instances in an organized manner. 
 
There was no logic to implement layout and navigation in the migration view component. Additionally, the &#x60;IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED&#x60; feature flag was not set, limiting usability concerning instance migrations.
 
Developers refactored the &#x60;InstancesList&#x60;, added the feature flag &#x60;IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED&#x60; and built a &#x60;MigrationView&#x60; component. They also added processInstanceMigrationStore to aid the migration process. The visual regression tests were updated to pass when &#x60;IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED&#x60; is false.
 
Users can now navigate through the instance migration process with ease. The system now features navigation buttons including back, next and confirm as described in the design, improving usability and system navigation. As for styling, it will be implemented in a future update.
#### [feat(api): Add jobKey in Incidents endpoint](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5707)

The incidents endpoint did not previously include a jobKey, which made it difficult to track and manage individual jobs associated with each incident. 
The product&#x27;s backend was initially developed without jobKey incorporation into the incidents endpoint. 
The jobKey was added to the Incidents endpoint, enabling more specific job identification. 
Users can now view and manage the jobKey associated with each incident via the Incidents endpoint.
#### [feat(backend): Implement interface for Opensearch migration.](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5655)

 Previously, there were no special migration steps, only the &quot;copy&quot; (reindex) step indicating that users had limited flexibility with migrations. Certain Plans were under-utilised and the index settings of Opensearch were not properly configured.
 The issue was caused due to the incomplete implementation of certain functionalities including &#x60;ReindexPlan&#x60;, &#x60;ReindexWithQueryAndScriptPlan&#x60;, &#x60;FillPostImporterQueuePlan&#x60;. Furthermore, misconfiguration of index settings for Opensearch was also a contributing factor.
 To address this, several key components have been implemented such as &#x60;ReindexPlan&#x60;, &#x60;ReindexWithQueryAndScriptPlan&#x60;, &#x60;FillPostImporterQueuePlan&#x60;. Index settings for Opensearch were corrected and ReindexIT was refactored to support tests for both Opensearch and Elasticsearch. The &#x60;ReindexPlan::buildScript&#x60; was removed due to it being redundant.
 Now, Opensearch migrations are more flexible and utilize the &#x60;ReindexPlan&#x60;, &#x60;ReindexWithQueryAndScriptPlan&#x60;, &#x60;FillPostImporterQueuePlan&#x60; functionalities. The index settings for Opensearch are properly configured, ensuring improved performance and reliability. The tests work seamlessly for both Opensearch and Elasticsearch without unnecessary functions.
#### [feat(backend): Implement tenant checks in OpensearchIncidentStatisticsReader](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5660)

Previously, there was no implemented tenant check in the OpensearchIncidentStatisticsReader, allowing all tenants&#x27; data to be accessible to everyone. 
This was due to the lack of a tenant-based filter in the method calling for incident statistics in the OpensearchIncidentStatisticsReader, leading to a form of permission hyperextension. 
A tenant check was implemented into the OpensearchIncidentStatisticsReader to ensure that only data relevant to the user&#x27;s tenant is shown.
Now, user&#x27;s can only access data related to their own tenant, increasing data security and privacy.
#### [feat(backend): Implement OpensearchProcessStore](https://github.com/camunda/operate/issues/5653)

### Identity > Misc > 🚀 New Features
#### [feat: allow multiple root urls](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2412)

Previously, the system only allowed a single root URL in the KeycloakClient object. This limited the functionality of the application making it less versatile for the users who needed support for multiple root URLs.
The root URL field in the KeycloakClient object was strictly treated as a single value field as it was technically engineered to accept only one URL which made the system less flexible.
We added support to make the root URL field in the KeycloakClient object able to be treated as a comma-separated value field. This change was the simplest approach after discussion and considerations.
Now, the system can accept multiple root URLs in the KeycloakClient object. This increased flexibility enhances user experience as they can now perform operations with multiple root URLs.
#### [feat: support custom client ids for camunda application](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2406)

 
Previously, users were restricted to the predefined client id definitions for all Camunda applications. This limitation posed challenges in situations where different client ids were desirable. 
 
The existing configuration did not allow the mapping of client ids through environmental variables. This lack of variable mapping paralleled how secrets were managed. 
 
To cater to the necessity of using unique client ids, variable mapping similar to that of secrets was introduced. This enabled the definition of custom client IDs for Operate, Optimize, Tasklist, Connectors, Console, and Web-Modeler through environmental variables. 
 
Clients can now utilize custom client ids for various Camunda applications, offering greater flexibility and tailored usage. The new configuration variables are well-documented to facilitate easy implementation.
#### [feat: add /ping endpoint for uptime check](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2380)

Before this fix, users were unable to check the uptime of the system without authentication, leading to limitations in monitoring system availability.
There was a lack of an endpoint that could provide uptime status without needing authentication. Furthermore, using the built-in Spring Health endpoint was not favoured due to the potential risks of accidentally exposing sensitive data. 
A &quot;/ping&quot; endpoint was implemented, specifically designed to return a 2xx status and be accessible without authentication. This implementation followed necessary precautions to prevent exposing too much data.
Users are now capable of verifying system uptime without needing to authenticate, improving the accessibility and convenience of system monitoring. This has been achieved while also ensuring data security hasn&#x27;t been compromised.
#### [feat: provider helper in sdk for authorization available](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2379)

Previously, users couldn&#x27;t accurately determine if authorization through identity was available or not, which led to complications in the configuration of Connectors with the new Identity configuration variables in Operate SDK.
The SDK lacked a helper method for indicating the availability of authorization through identity.
A helper method was added to the SDK. This method indicates whether authorization through identity is available or not.
Now, it&#x27;s easy to determine if Connectors has been configured with the new Identity configuration variables. This method could potentially substitute for the built-in authentication handling in Operate SDK.
#### [feat: add a helper to determine identity user search availability](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2356)

Users of the Optimize function in camunda-cloud&#x27;s product-hub previously had no way of determining whether the user search feature was available based on camunda-cloud/identity&#x27;s configuration, and this functionality could display in the Optimize UI, even if not usable.
There was no helper function in the identity configuration to check the availability of the user search feature. Additionally, there was no handling for potential scenarios where there may be a null or empty baseUrl which would render the search feature unusable.
A helper function was added to determine the availability of the identity user search feature considering the identity configuration type, as well as checking for null or empty baseUrl.
The system now ensures the user search feature is available before allowing it to be used in the Optimize UI. It correctly hides this functionality if it&#x27;s not usable based on system configuration or if the baseUrl is empty or null.
#### [feat: implement generic auth proile](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2327)

Users were unable to establish connections that were not covered by our platform-specific implementations, limitting the range of available authentication methods. 
The system lacked a &#x27;GENERIC&#x27; auth type configuration, causing users to be restricted to specific pre-configured platforms. Code duplication in Keycloak and AzureAD implementations also created redundant operations and complexity.
We introduced a &#x27;GENERIC&#x27; auth type that allows for more varied connection types. Additionally, Keycloak and AzureAD implementations were refactored to use the generic implementation, reducing code duplication and complexity.
Users can now establish connections that were previously not supported, expanding the types of authentication methods available. Extra code from the Keycloak and AzureAD implementations has been eliminated, making the codebase more efficient.
#### [feat: expose user groups via SDK](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2303)

Previously, users were unable to access the group information of users through the SDK in our self manage offering for Tasklist. 
The issue was due to a lack of a functionality within our system to expose user group details linked to a token.
We&#x27;ve implemented a new mapper and exposed the user group details as part of the user details that can be accessed through a token.
Currently, the SDK now clearly provides users with the relevant group information, enhancing the functionality of our self-managed offering for Tasklist.
#### [feat: add read:users permission to the Optimize role](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2296)

Previously, the Optimize role did not have the ability to read user data. 
The cause was an oversight in the defining of role permissions, where the &quot;read:users&quot; permission was not assigned to the Optimize role. 
The issue was resolved by adding the necessary &quot;read:users&quot; permission to the Optimize role.
Now, the Optimize role can access and read user data.
#### [feat: add support for AWS Aurora database](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2266)

 Customers were not able to connect to the AWS Aurora database through our system, as there was no support integrated for this. 
 This limitation was due to the system lacking the required code changes to establish a connection with the AWS Aurora database, specifically it was missing the usage of the appropriate aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper with the IAM plugin. 
 We made the necessary updates to the system&#x27;s code base. Now, it leverages the aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper with the IAM plugin for establishing a connection with the AWS Aurora database. 
 Today, users can successfully connect to an AWS Aurora database directly through our system.

#### [feat: implement identity spring boot starter](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2184)

Previously, the operating system lacked a foundational Identity Spring Boot Starter, adding to the difficulty for users to maintain identity management.
This issue arose because the identity management component hadn&#x27;t been implemented within the Spring Boot Starter.
To rectify this deficiency, a new Identity Spring Boot Starter was introduced in the system. Along this change, the variable prefix was also adjusted to be more in line with the other components.
With this update, users can now leverage the Identity Spring Boot Starter, offering a more streamlined experience in managing identities. Additionally, the use of environment variables like &#x60;CAMUNDA_IDENTITY_BASEURL&#x60; will provide enhanced context and ease of use.
#### [feat: allow multiple root urls](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2412)

Now, the Optimize role can access and read user data.
#### [feat: implement Azure AD sdk profile](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2273)

 Previously, users were not able to use Azure AD for authentication as it was not implemented.
 
 The platform was initially designed to only support Keycloak for authentication. The lack of &#x60;preferred_username&#x60; claim in Azure AD access token due to hardcoded values was also an issue.
 A new class was created featuring the Azure AD SDK profile implementation, allowing for Azure AD support in the application. The issue related to the &#x60;preferred_username&#x60; claim was addressed by duplicating some code and creating a new implementation.
 Users can now choose to authenticate using Azure AD, and the application can process Azure AD&#x27;s access tokens correctly. Future iterations will aim to create a more generic set of classes to streamline the authentication process.

#### [feat: add support for AWS Aurora database](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2266)

#### [feat: add implementation info to SDK jar](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2148)

 Previously, users faced difficulty in end-to-end testing with Zeebe. The system was overly-sensitive to faults as the Identity snapshot version could change at any time. The problem was compounded when needing to support older versions, resulting in skew as the old software development kit (SDK) did not align with the snapshot version. 
 The issue was rooted in the lack of implementation information in the MANIFEST.MF of the jar. The absence of this information made it challenging to determine the Identity version used in other projects that depend on this SDK during runtime. 
 We added the required implementation information inside the MANIFEST.MF of the jar. This addition ensures that the Identity version being used in other projects that depend on this SDK is accessible during runtime. 
 Now users can effortlessly retrieve the version they depend on during runtime and utilize this for a Docker image in their end-to-end tests. This improvement significantly enhances the end-to-end testing process with Zeebe by ensuring alignment with snapshot versions and effectively supporting older versions.
#### [feat: support initializing access rules by config](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2161)

 Previously, the system did not support initializing access rules via configurations. As a result, difficulties were faced by internal teams and customers during automation tasks due to the complexity of manually assigning members to tenants.
 The issue arose because the system&#x27;s ability to automatically create tenants and assign members to them using configuration was not developed, which could have led to unnecessary manual intervention 
 A change was implemented in the initializer to support creation of tenants and assigning members to these tenants via configuration. Also, protection was added to avoid the default tenant from being overwritten and removed, avoiding any future inconsistencies.
 Now, the system supports initializing access rules through configuration, simplifying the process of automation. The &#x60;&lt;default&gt;&#x60; tenant is protected and cannot be overwritten or removed, ensuring the environment stability.
#### [feat: implement GET /authorizations endpoint](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2109)

 Users with specific permissions were unable to access the authorization data for an organization.
 The &#x60;permissions&#x60; claim found on JWTs from Auth0 was ignored due to audience issues. Keycloak&#x27;s &#x60;getPermissions&#x60; method returned a null pointer exception on an invalid token structure.
 Tweaks were made to the SDK to include the &#x60;permissions&#x60; claim and the Keycloak implementation of the &#x60;getPermissions&#x60; method was revised to return an empty list instead of a NPE. The entity ID and type related to the authorization was added to the existing responses for more extensive retrieval of all authorizations.
 Now, users with specific permissions can access an organization&#x27;s authorization data. An invalid token structure in Keycloak&#x27;s &#x60;getPermissions&#x60; method returns an empty list instead of producing an error. The entity ID and type are now included in the authorization data, making it more comprehensive and informative.
#### [feat: add /ping endpoint for uptime check](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2380)

Before this fix, users were unable to check the uptime of the system without authentication, leading to limitations in monitoring system availability.

 The platform was initially designed to only support Keycloak for authentication. The lack of &#x60;preferred_username&#x60; claim in Azure AD access token due to hardcoded values was also an issue.
 A new class was created featuring the Azure AD SDK profile implementation, allowing for Azure AD support in the application. The issue related to the &#x60;preferred_username&#x60; claim was addressed by duplicating some code and creating a new implementation.
 Users can now choose to authenticate using Azure AD, and the application can process Azure AD&#x27;s access tokens correctly. Future iterations will aim to create a more generic set of classes to streamline the authentication process.

#### [feat: add support for AWS Aurora database](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2266)

 Customers were not able to connect to the AWS Aurora database through our system, as there was no support integrated for this. 
 This limitation was due to the system lacking the required code changes to establish a connection with the AWS Aurora database, specifically it was missing the usage of the appropriate aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper with the IAM plugin. 
 We made the necessary updates to the system&#x27;s code base. Now, it leverages the aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper with the IAM plugin for establishing a connection with the AWS Aurora database. 
 Today, users can successfully connect to an AWS Aurora database directly through our system.

#### [feat: implement identity spring boot starter](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2184)

Previously, the operating system lacked a foundational Identity Spring Boot Starter, adding to the difficulty for users to maintain identity management.
This issue arose because the identity management component hadn&#x27;t been implemented within the Spring Boot Starter.
To rectify this deficiency, a new Identity Spring Boot Starter was introduced in the system. Along this change, the variable prefix was also adjusted to be more in line with the other components.
With this update, users can now leverage the Identity Spring Boot Starter, offering a more streamlined experience in managing identities. Additionally, the use of environment variables like &#x60;CAMUNDA_IDENTITY_BASEURL&#x60; will provide enhanced context and ease of use.
#### [feat: add implementation info to SDK jar](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2148)

 Previously, users faced difficulty in end-to-end testing with Zeebe. The system was overly-sensitive to faults as the Identity snapshot version could change at any time. The problem was compounded when needing to support older versions, resulting in skew as the old software development kit (SDK) did not align with the snapshot version. 
 The issue was rooted in the lack of implementation information in the MANIFEST.MF of the jar. The absence of this information made it challenging to determine the Identity version used in other projects that depend on this SDK during runtime. 
 We added the required implementation information inside the MANIFEST.MF of the jar. This addition ensures that the Identity version being used in other projects that depend on this SDK is accessible during runtime. 
 Now users can effortlessly retrieve the version they depend on during runtime and utilize this for a Docker image in their end-to-end tests. This improvement significantly enhances the end-to-end testing process with Zeebe by ensuring alignment with snapshot versions and effectively supporting older versions.
#### [feat: support initializing access rules by config](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2161)

 Previously, the system did not support initializing access rules via configurations. As a result, difficulties were faced by internal teams and customers during automation tasks due to the complexity of manually assigning members to tenants.
 The issue arose because the system&#x27;s ability to automatically create tenants and assign members to them using configuration was not developed, which could have led to unnecessary manual intervention 
 A change was implemented in the initializer to support creation of tenants and assigning members to these tenants via configuration. Also, protection was added to avoid the default tenant from being overwritten and removed, avoiding any future inconsistencies.
 Now, the system supports initializing access rules through configuration, simplifying the process of automation. The &#x60;&lt;default&gt;&#x60; tenant is protected and cannot be overwritten or removed, ensuring the environment stability.
#### [feat: implement GET /authorizations endpoint](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2109)

 Users with specific permissions were unable to access the authorization data for an organization.
 The &#x60;permissions&#x60; claim found on JWTs from Auth0 was ignored due to audience issues. Keycloak&#x27;s &#x60;getPermissions&#x60; method returned a null pointer exception on an invalid token structure.
 Tweaks were made to the SDK to include the &#x60;permissions&#x60; claim and the Keycloak implementation of the &#x60;getPermissions&#x60; method was revised to return an empty list instead of a NPE. The entity ID and type related to the authorization was added to the existing responses for more extensive retrieval of all authorizations.
 Now, users with specific permissions can access an organization&#x27;s authorization data. An invalid token structure in Keycloak&#x27;s &#x60;getPermissions&#x60; method returns an empty list instead of producing an error. The entity ID and type are now included in the authorization data, making it more comprehensive and informative.
#### [feat: implement Azure AD sdk profile](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2273)

 Previously, users were not able to use Azure AD for authentication as it was not implemented.
 
 The platform was initially designed to only support Keycloak for authentication. The lack of &#x60;preferred_username&#x60; claim in Azure AD access token due to hardcoded values was also an issue.
 A new class was created featuring the Azure AD SDK profile implementation, allowing for Azure AD support in the application. The issue related to the &#x60;preferred_username&#x60; claim was addressed by duplicating some code and creating a new implementation.

#### [fix: update c4-identity to fix multiple tenants assignment](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2213)

 Previously, users were unable to assign multiple tenants to an entity, which limited the system&#x27;s functionality and caused inconvenience for users who needed this feature. 
 The root cause was an issue within the &#x60;c4-identity&#x60; library which our system relies on for tenant assignment. Specific details of the technical problem are not given, but it prevented multiple tenant assignments from happening for one entity. 
 The issue was resolved by upgrading the &#x60;c4-identity&#x60; library to a version in which this bug had been fixed. The library was successfully updated and thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions as intended. 
 Now, users can assign multiple tenants to an entity without any problem. The system&#x27;s functionality in this aspect reflects the update, providing a smoother and more flexible user experience.
#### [fix: dependency issues causing tests to not run](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2268)

Previously, dependency issues were causing tests not to run. 
This was due to a conflict of dependency versions for the Jupiter artifacts. Setting the versions via a &#x27;dependencyManagement&#x27; block did not resolve the issue. 
The issue was addressed in two ways: (1) the Jupiter versions were set to a version that works properly and (2) the maven failsafe plugin was configured to fail the build if no tests are run during the verification stage for the management-api artifact.
Now, as a measure of robustness, even if there are no integration tests that run during the validation phase in the &#x27;management-api&#x27; module, the build fails (unless the tests are skipped using &#x27;-DskipTests&#x3D;true&#x27;). This change ensures our builds return to a credible position.
#### [fix: fix access rules retrieval](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2265)

Previously, when retrieving access rules, no rows were being found even if an existing access rule was not associated with at least one tenant.
This issue was due to the use of &#x60;JOIN tenants&#x60; instead of &#x60;LEFT JOIN tenants&#x60; when retrieving access rules.
The code was updated to use &#x60;LEFT JOIN tenants&#x60; instead of &#x60;JOIN tenants&#x60;. This allows access rules to be retrieved even if they are not linked to a tenant.
Now, users can effectively retrieve access rules regardless of their association with tenants.

#### [fix: dependency issues causing tests to not run](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2268)

Previously, dependency issues were causing tests not to run. 
This was due to a conflict of dependency versions for the Jupiter artifacts. Setting the versions via a &#x27;dependencyManagement&#x27; block did not resolve the issue. 
The issue was addressed in two ways: (1) the Jupiter versions were set to a version that works properly and (2) the maven failsafe plugin was configured to fail the build if no tests are run during the verification stage for the management-api artifact.
Now, as a measure of robustness, even if there are no integration tests that run during the validation phase in the &#x27;management-api&#x27; module, the build fails (unless the tests are skipped using &#x27;-DskipTests&#x3D;true&#x27;). This change ensures our builds return to a credible position.
#### [fix: fix access rules retrieval](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2265)

Previously, when retrieving access rules, no rows were being found even if an existing access rule was not associated with at least one tenant.
This issue was due to the use of &#x60;JOIN tenants&#x60; instead of &#x60;LEFT JOIN tenants&#x60; when retrieving access rules.
The code was updated to use &#x60;LEFT JOIN tenants&#x60; instead of &#x60;JOIN tenants&#x60;. This allows access rules to be retrieved even if they are not linked to a tenant.
Now, users can effectively retrieve access rules regardless of their association with tenants.

Previously, users were operating with an outdated dependency (org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-layout-template-json), which may have led to unexpected behaviour or gaps in functionality. 
The issue was simply an outdated dependency in the software, being at version 2.20.0 when a newer version, 2.21.1, was available.
The issue was resolved by updating the aforementioned dependency to the latest version, v2.21.1, ensuring that all associated features were up-to-date and functioning as expected.
Users can now utilize the system with this improved underlying structure. The application should now run more smoothly and reliably with the updated dependency.
#### [fix: update dependency axios to v1.6.0 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2249)

Without the details of a specific GitHub issue, I cannot create a release note. Please provide the details of the GitHub issue, including the problem it addressed and what was done to fix it.
#### [fix: update dependency @carbon/react to v1.41.1 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2247)

 Users of the application experienced outdated functionalities due to the use of version 1.40.0 of @carbon/react dependency.
 The application was running on an older version of @carbon/react dependency (1.40.0) which had some obsolete features.
 The @carbon/react dependency was updated from version 1.40.0 to 1.41.1, incorporating the most current functionalities and bug fix of this library.
 The application now runs on @carbon/react dependency version 1.41.1, enhancing the efficiency and performance of the software and offering up-to-date features to the users.

I&#x27;m sorry but I can only generate a release note if I have a GitHub issue description. Could you provide the necessary details?
#### [fix: use java 17 to build new artifacts](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2225)

Previously, the deployment of the new &#x60;-starter&#x60; and &#x60;-autoconfigure&#x60; artifacts was failing as it was being executed with Java 11.
The issue originated due to the build process using an older version, Java 11, whereas it needed to use Java 17 to correctly build the new artifacts.
The build process was updated to use Java 17 for deploying new artifacts to resolve the underlying issue.
Now, the deployment of the &#x60;-starter&#x60; and &#x60;-autoconfigure&#x60; artifacts is carried out successfully using Java 17. It unblocks the Operate team, allowing them to advance with their tasks. The system now behaves as expected, confirming that the issue has been resolved.
#### [fix: update dependency io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus to v1.11.5 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2223)

 
Users were experiencing errors normal behavior because of null values in ObservationRegistry.NOOP and could encounter ConcurrentModificationException when performing computations with Observation$Context.computeIfAbsent.
 
The underlying cause of this issue was traced back to the use of an older version (version 1.11.3) of the io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus dependency.
 
The technical fix involved updating the dependency io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus to its latest stable version (1.11.5). This version includes patches for the issues users were facing, along with other critical fixes and dependencies upgrades.
 
With the application of this fix, users should no longer encounter null values in ObservationRegistry.NOOP or ConcurrentModificationException when performing certain operations. The system performance and stability should now be improved.
#### [fix: update dependency com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind to v2.15.3 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2222)

Users were experiencing issues due to outdated dependencies.
The usage of an old version (&#x60;2.15.2&#x60;) of &#x60;com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind&#x60; resulted in some compatibility issues. 
The dependency was updated from &#x60;2.15.2&#x60; to &#x60;2.15.3&#x60;.
With the updated dependency, the application now runs smoothly without any compatibility issues.
#### [fix: update dependency axios to v1.5.1 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2218)

Apologies for the confusion, could you please provide the specific details of the GitHub issue that needs to be translated into a release note? These details should include what the issue is about, the cause of the issue, and how it was fixed.
#### [fix: update dependency com.auth0:auth0 to v1.45.1 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2219)

Prior to this update, users may have encountered security vulnerabilities due to the usage of an outdated version of Okio library in the Auth0 package.
This was due to the product relying on the &#x60;1.45.0&#x60; version of &#x60;com.auth0:auth0&#x60; dependency which was linked with outdated Okio library, known for CVE-2023-3635 issue.
The product dependency &#x60;com.auth0:auth0&#x60; was updated from version &#x60;1.45.0&#x60; to &#x60;1.45.1&#x60;. This new version incorporated the updated Okio library that resolved the CVE-2023-3635 security vulnerability.
As a result of this fix, users can now use the application securely with the updated Auth0 dependency that no longer has the known Okio security vulnerability.
#### [fix: upgrade org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web from 3.1.4 to 3.1.5](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2191)

Our project&#x27;s application previously utilized version 3.1.4 of org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web, which had certain vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities included Denial of Service (DoS), Improper Input Validation, Incomplete Cleanup, and Arbitrary Code Execution, all impacting the system&#x27;s security and stability.
The vulnerabilities were due to the older version (3.1.4) of the org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web package, which was used in our project. This older version was laden with several security flaws.
To mitigate these risks, we have upgraded the package org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web from version 3.1.4 to 3.1.5. This update occurred in the pom.xml file under the management-api repository. 
With the implementation of the new package version (3.1.5), the system now operates with increased security and reduced risk of the aforementioned vulnerabilities. The application is more robust against attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), Improper Input Validation, Incomplete Cleanup, and Arbitrary Code Execution.
#### [fix: resolve lazy loading issue with tenants linked to access rules](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2180)

 
Previously, when trying to assign members in the configuration for tenants, an exception occurred. An error message of &#x60;org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: io.camunda.identity.entity.AccessRule.tenants: could not initialize proxy - no Session&#x60; was displayed. 
 
The problem stemmed from a lazy loading issue when attempting to retrieve the tenants for the access rule to which a member was being assigned. The Hibernate session was not extended enough for the full functionality.
The issue was resolved by implementing &#x60;JOIN FETCH&#x60; approach, which allowed proper initialization of the Hibernate session for tenant retrieval. This was chosen over the &#x60;FetchType.EAGER&#x60; method which is generally not recommended. 
Now, you can assign members in the tenants&#x27; configuration without encountering any exceptions. The code changes are fully covered by tests and the overall system now operates more smoothly.
#### [fix: update dependency @carbon/react to v1.40.0 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2103)

Users were facing inconsistencies and potential bugs in the application due to the outdated version of the @carbon/react dependency. 
The application was using an outdated version (1.35.0) of @carbon/react, which might not have been compatible with the other parts of the codebase. 
The codebase was updated to use the version 1.40.0 of @carbon/react to make sure that application is running on the latest and most compatible version of the dependency. 
Now, the application has an updated @carbon/react dependency, thus users will experience a more consistent, bug-free, and efficient functioning of the application. The update assures more stability and increased compatibility with other parts of the codebase.
#### [fix: fix for 2 vulnerabilities](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2133)

In the past, users could have had potential security issues due to two medium severity vulnerabilities related to access restriction bypass and incorrect permission assignment for critical resources.
This issue was due to the use of vulnerable versions of the &#x27;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web&#x27; and &#x27;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security&#x27; dependencies in the &#x60;maven&#x60; of the project.
These vulnerabilities were remedied by upgrading the versions of the dependencies in the &#x60;maven&#x60;. Specifically, both &#x27;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web&#x27; and &#x27;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security&#x27; were updated from version &#x60;3.1.3&#x60; to &#x60;3.1.4&#x60;.
With this fix, the system no longer has these security vulnerabilities. Users can now utilise the application with the assurance that the identified vulnerabilities have been addressed.
#### [fix: only create log file when required](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2164)

 Previously, users noticed that the Log4J2 system was constantly creating a log file, an action which was not always required.
 The reason this was happening was due to our configuration settings for the Log4J2 system. This option was toggled on by default, leading to the unnecessary creation of log files.
 To resolve this, we introduced a property to the configuration which allows us to control whether the log file should be created or not.
 Now, log files are only made when needed, resulting in a more efficient system and less unnecessary storage usage.
#### [fix: prevent body on GET call in serviceWorker](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2153)

 Prior to the fix, the &#x60;/tenants&#x60; page failed to load for users due to a bug in the serviceWorker. 
 Technically speaking, an issue was identified where the serviceWorker was improperly setting a body for &#x60;GET&#x60; calls, causing the page load failures. 
 To resolve this, we altered the logic in the serviceWorker to specifically avoid setting a body for &#x60;GET&#x60; calls.
 With this fix, the &#x60;/tenants&#x60; page should now load properly without any interruptions. The logic update ensures that &#x60;GET&#x60; calls function as expected, providing improved page stability and usability.
#### [fix: update c4-identity to fix multiple tenants assignment](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2213)

 Previously, users were unable to assign multiple tenants to an entity, which limited the system&#x27;s functionality and caused inconvenience for users who needed this feature. 
 The root cause was an issue within the &#x60;c4-identity&#x60; library which our system relies on for tenant assignment. Specific details of the technical problem are not given, but it prevented multiple tenant assignments from happening for one entity. 
 The issue was resolved by upgrading the &#x60;c4-identity&#x60; library to a version in which this bug had been fixed. The library was successfully updated and thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions as intended. 
 Now, users can assign multiple tenants to an entity without any problem. The system&#x27;s functionality in this aspect reflects the update, providing a smoother and more flexible user experience.
#### [fix: upgrade software.amazon.awssdk:rds from 2.21.13 to 2.21.15](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2274)

 The system was susceptible to &quot;Improper Certificate Validation&quot;, a medium severity vulnerability, resulting from the utilization of &#x60;software.amazon.awssdk:rds&#x60; version &#x60;2.21.13&#x60;.
 The underlying issue was an outdated version of the &#x60;software.amazon.awssdk:rds&#x60; dependency in the &#x60;management-api/pom.xml&#x60; file. This older version did not have adequate measures to prevent improper certificate validation.
 The issue was resolved by upgrading the &#x60;software.amazon.awssdk:rds&#x60; from version &#x60;2.21.13&#x60; to &#x60;2.21.15&#x60;. Changes were made to the &#x60;management-api/pom.xml&#x60; file to reflect this upgrade.
 Currently, the system is no longer vulnerable to the &quot;Improper Certificate Validation&quot; issue, thus enhancing overall security. The upgrade in the &#x60;software.amazon.awssdk:rds&#x60; dependency has addressed this vulnerability effectively.
#### [fix: dependency issues causing tests to not run](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2268)

Previously, dependency issues were causing tests not to run. 
This was due to a conflict of dependency versions for the Jupiter artifacts. Setting the versions via a &#x27;dependencyManagement&#x27; block did not resolve the issue. 
The issue was addressed in two ways: (1) the Jupiter versions were set to a version that works properly and (2) the maven failsafe plugin was configured to fail the build if no tests are run during the verification stage for the management-api artifact.
Now, as a measure of robustness, even if there are no integration tests that run during the validation phase in the &#x27;management-api&#x27; module, the build fails (unless the tests are skipped using &#x27;-DskipTests&#x3D;true&#x27;). This change ensures our builds return to a credible position.
#### [fix: fix access rules retrieval](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2265)

Previously, when retrieving access rules, no rows were being found even if an existing access rule was not associated with at least one tenant.
This issue was due to the use of &#x60;JOIN tenants&#x60; instead of &#x60;LEFT JOIN tenants&#x60; when retrieving access rules.
The code was updated to use &#x60;LEFT JOIN tenants&#x60; instead of &#x60;JOIN tenants&#x60;. This allows access rules to be retrieved even if they are not linked to a tenant.
Now, users can effectively retrieve access rules regardless of their association with tenants.
#### [fix: update dependency @carbon/motion to v11.16.1 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2246)

This issue can&#x27;t be completed as the provided content does not provide adequate information to create a release note. Please provide issue details reflecting consequence, cause, fix and result.
#### [fix: update dependency @carbon/themes to v11.26.1 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2248)

The old version @carbon/themes (11.24.0) used in the application was outdated
There were updates in the @carbon/themes package that the application was not implementing.
The dependency of @carbon/themes was updated to v11.26.1, ensuring the package is current with the latest updates.
The application now uses the updated version (v11.26.1) of @carbon/themes, which integrates the most recent changes and improvements in this package. The users can now benefit from these updates.
#### [fix: update dependency org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-layout-template-json to v2.21.1 (main)](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/identity/issues/2250)

Previously, users were operating with an outdated dependency (org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-layout-template-json), which may have led to unexpected behaviour or gaps in functionality. 
The issue was simply an outdated dependency in the software, being at version 2.20.0 when a newer version, 2.21.1, was available.
The issue was resolved by updating the aforementioned dependency to the latest version, v2.21.1, ensuring that all associated features were up-to-date and functioning as expected.
Users can now utilize the system with this improved underlying structure. The application should now run more smoothly and reliably with the updated dependency.

### Tasklist > Misc > 🚀 New Features
#### [feat: support for ES 8.9](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3900)

 Before the fix, our system did not support ElasticSearch (ES) version 8.9, which affected interoperability for some users who run on that version.
 This was because the ElasticSearchConnector was not configured to support ES version 8.9, and the version of Spring boot (3.1) we were using was not compatible with ES java client 8.9. 
 To resolve this issue, we added a new Bean to the ElasticSearchConnector and updated ES versions everywhere in our system as per the workaround suggested in the Spring Boot GitHub issue #36669.
 Now, the system can interact seamlessly with ES 8.9 and above, providing greater flexibility and compatibility for our users. This fix has been tested and confirmed to support the updated ES versions.
#### [feat: Implement User Group Retrieval and Access Restrictions in Tasklist (Self Management)](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3868)

Users were unable to retrieve their user groups and had restrictions accessing tasks in the management system.
The underlying issue was inefficient queries and lack of proper OpenSearch support in the system.
We optimized the system&#x27;s queries, introduced changes supporting OpenSearch, and updated the TaskController unit tests. These improvements occurred primarily in the TaskControllerTest.java, TaskStoreOpenSearch.java, and TaskService.java files.
Now, users can retrieve their groups and do not face access restrictions in the task management system. OpenSearch support has been enhanced for a smoother user experience.
#### [feat: Extend Task Search API to Include Task Variables](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3786)

Previously, users were not able to fetch task variables when querying tasks due to a limitation in the task search API. This led to incomplete information being returned to the user.
This was due to the Task Search API not being set up to retrieve task variables. Specifically, runtime variables for &#x27;CREATED&#x27; tasks, task variables for &#x27;COMPLETED&#x27; tasks, and draft variables were not being fetched.
In response to the issue, the search task API was updated to fetch task variables. After querying for tasks, the &#x60;VariableService.getVariablesPerTaskId(List&lt;GetVariablesRequest&gt;)&#x60; was used to fetch tasks&#x27; variables. The task variables were then matched with the &#x60;includeVariables&#x60; in the search request. As part of the update, runtime variables are fetched for &#x27;CREATED&#x27; tasks, task variables are fetched for &#x27;COMPLETED&#x27; tasks, and draft variables are not fetched.
Now, when users query tasks using the search task API, the returned information includes relevant task variables. This ensures that the users have access to all necessary information related to each task.
#### [feat: Update error message when form fetch fails](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3899)

Users were receiving a generic error message when a form fetch failed, providing little to no detail about the actual error or its cause.
The underlying system was not effectively handling or communicating the specifics of form fetch failures.
We improved the error message related to form fetch failures, providing more details about the issue. The updated code correctly addresses form fetch failures and delivers more comprehensive error messages.
Now, when a form fetch fails, users receive a more detailed and instructive error message helping them understand the cause of the failure, thus improving overall user experience.
#### [feat: use identity spring boot starter](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3846)

Users previously faced difficulty with the old configuration style for the Identity SDK. The lack of a spring boot start approach was causing issues with authentication, particularly in complex environments like Azure AD.
The issue stemmed from using a dated configuration style for the Identity SDK. The system lacked the benefits of a spring boot start approach, which led to authentication problems.
A spring boot start approach was introduced to replace the old Identity SDK configuration style. This change is in line with similar updates that were made in the Operate codebase, bringing a degree of continuity across platforms.
Now, users can successfully authenticate with the new spring boot start approach. The unit/integration tests confirm the successful implementation of this feature. The experience with Azure AD has been specifically tested and validated.
#### [feat: Delete process definition in Tasklist](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3738)

 Users were unable to delete a process definition in tasklist, which included all related objects such as tasks, task variables, process entities, and embedded forms. In specific scenarios, this was an issue when the user needed to remove all occurrences and references to a particular process definition.
 : The feature to handle the deletion of a process definition with its related objects in tasklist was missing.
 The system has been updated to include the feature to handle deletion of process definitions in tasklist.  This is implemented by marking a process definition for deletion and allowing an archival process to delete related objects, ensuring efficient resource allocation and usage. An alternative approach would have been to handle the deletion by the importer, though this would potentially block the importer in the case of a high number of objects to delete. 
 Users now have the option to delete a process definition in tasklist. All related entities and occurrences are also deleted, preserving data integrity and workspace cleanliness.
#### [feat(form): replace carbon-styles with SASS stylesheet](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3749)

The software was using the carbon-styles library, which was causing compatibility and performance issues.
This issue was caused by the choice to use the carbon-styles library over the native SASS stylesheet module, which led to sub-optimal performance of the application.
The application&#x27;s code was updated, replacing all instances of the carbon-styles library with the SASS stylesheet. Comprehensive acceptance, unit, and integration tests were performed to confirm the successful swapping of the libraries.
The switch to SASS stylesheets has made the application perform more efficiently and eliminated previous compatibility issues, thus improving the overall user experience.
#### [feat: add the java event for the form deletion ](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3746)


Previously, the user experience was hindered due to the lack of support for Form Deletion in the 8.4.0 version of the importer. Also, system behavior inconsistencies appeared between versions, as resources unsupported by Zeebe in the 8.3.0 version did not need such functionality.
This condition arose because the initial feature set did not integrate Form Deletion support into version 8.4.0 of the importer.
This issue was addressed by extending support to Form Deletion in importer 8.4.0 and updating the integration tests. The APIs to handle deletion were updated in this process as well.
The system now effectively supports form deletion in importer 8.4.0. Users can observe this feature working as expected. The enhancement can be tested with the &#x60;getLinkedFormHighestVersionWithFormDeletion&#x60; Java Client.

#### [feat: adding ISM to OpenSearch](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3731)

Prior to the update, OpenSearch users did not have access to the Index State Management (ISM) feature. Without this feature, managing the lifecycle of an index was more complex and time-consuming. 
This limitation was due to the absence of ISM integration within OpenSearch. The system lacked the necessary code to enable these management features. 
A solution was implemented where ISM support was added to OpenSearch. The required parameters and relevant coding measures were added to incorporate ISM functionality. 
OpenSearch users currently have access to the ISM feature, which simplifies managing the lifecycle of an index. This enhances user experience and efficiency in managing indices within OpenSearch.
#### [feat: Add support for deployed forms in tasks](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3716)

Users were unable to use deployed forms in tasks due to a lack of support. 
The system wasn&#x27;t designed to handle form versioning, form IDs, and the state of whether a form is embedded or not. 
Support for deployed forms in tasks was implemented by introducing changes to handle form versioning, form ID, and the state of whether a form is embedded or not. Also, the tests were updated to cover these new scenarios.
Users can now use deployed forms in tasks without any issues. The system&#x27;s handling of form versioning, form IDs, and the status of whether a form is embedded or not has substantially improved.
#### [feat: add isDeleted to Form API Response](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3723)

Users were not able to determine if a form had been deleted or not on Zeebe as there was no indication in the Form API response.
The Form API response lacked a &#x27;isDeleted&#x27; field to display the deletion status.
A &#x27;isDeleted&#x27; field was introduced to the Form API response to show whether a form has been deleted or not on Zeebe.
Now, users can see in the Form API response if a form has been deleted on Zeebe.
#### [feat: Add Form importes for the version 8.4](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3671)

 Prior to the update, users were unable to import forms related information for version 8.4 due to the lack of form importers.  
 The JobZeebeRecordProcessor - for both Elasticsearch and OpenSearch - could not process job records and persist tasks with form related information.  
 We introduced form importers in version 8.4, as part of this update. We made changes to the JobZeebeRecordProcessor for Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, enabling it to process job records and persist tasks with form-related information. We also introduced a new FormRecordImpl class.  
 Users can now import forms for version 8.4 and persist tasks with form-related information in both Elasticsearch and OpenSearch.
#### [feat: improvements on Importers](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3614)

Previously, users were facing issues with importers. The migration process became stuck after reindex tasks failed. Shard failures were not taken into account when counting already migrated documents. Moreover, even after a successful migration, another round of migration was initiated unnecessarily.
The problem was largely a result of flaws in our migration process. Our reindexing tasks were not handling errors effectively, leading to stuck migrations. Additionally, the migration count methodology did not accommodate shard failures, leading to inaccurate counts. Finally, our system was reinitialising unnecessary migration rounds after a successful cycle.
Significant improvements were introduced in Importers. This included improved error handling mechanism to prevent the migration from getting stuck following reindex tasks failures; inclusion of shard failures in the migration count; and ensuring no further round of migration is submitted following a successful migration.
With these improvements, users&#x27; experience with Importers is significantly enhanced. Any issues with reindex tasks no longer lead to stuck migrations. Shard failures are now accounted for during the migration process, and another round of migration is not initiated unnecessarily. As a result, the migration process is more streamlined and efficient.
#### [feat: Import from zeebe form deployment (ElasticSearch/OpenSearch)](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3526)

Users were unable to correctly import data from Zeebe for both linked and embedded forms due to an indexing issue. This affected the ability to effectively use these forms following deployment. 
This resulted from discrepancies in how data models were handled for linked and embedded forms. The system wasn&#x27;t correctly associating an ID with the processKey in linked forms, and the bpmnId for deployed forms was shown as null.
The indexing issue was addressed by updating the form index. During a new form deployment, data import from Zeebe is initiated. For linked forms, the ID is now correctly identified as the processKey and processDefinitionId is addressed as null for deployed forms. 
The system now correctly associates IDs with the processKey for linked forms and null with processDefinitionId for deployed forms. Users can now seamlessly import data from Zeebe during new form deployments.

#### [feat: Add Unit and Integration tests for OpenAPI](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3574)

Without proper integration and unit tests, the Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation was being loaded without validation, and pages were potentially being generated without alignment to configurations. 
Previously, the application missed essential integration tests to validate the loading process of the Swagger specification, and there were no unit tests to check if the pages were being generated according to the specified configurations.
Unit and integration tests were added. The integration test validates if the Swagger is being loaded properly, and the unit test checks if pages are generated in line with the setup configurations. 
Now, the Swagger is validated upon loading, and pages are properly generated according to the pre-set configurations, which ensures more stable and accurate software performance.
### Tasklist > Misc > 💊 Bugfixes
#### [fix: Some Identity configuration parameters are not taken from CAMUND…](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3967)

 
Previously, certain Identity configuration parameters were not recognized from the CAMUNDA_TASKLIST_* environment variables, resulting in inconsistencies and potential system misconfigurations.
 
This issue was a result of the technical oversight in the product&#x27;s software; environment variables were not being correctly read and implemented into the Identity configuration parameters.
 
A coding adjustment was made to rectify the way in which CAMUNDA_TASKLIST_* environment variables are absorbed and translated into Identity configuration parameters. The fix was tested and validated against defined acceptance criteria.
 
With the applied fix, the Identity configuration now correctly takes into account the parameters set in the CAMUNDA_TASKLIST_* environment variables, which results in stabilized and reliable configurations of the system. All tests run (unit/integration and E2E) as well as manual tests verify the fix.
#### [fix: temporar fix for clear scroll for AWS opensearch](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3955)

Users were experiencing an exception in the Camunda Tasklist when using AWS opensearch.
This exception was being thrown because of an issue with the clear scroll functionality.
A temporary fix was applied to catch the exception reported in issue #3939, until a long term solution can be found.
Overall stability of the Camunda Tasklist has improved for users using AWS opensearch, preventing the previously observed exceptions. Further adjustments will be made in the future for a long-term fix.
#### [fix: creating aliases in case they don&#x27;t exist](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3904)

Previously, users experienced issues with aliases as they were failing to be created when non-existent. This issue was causing failures in some environments.
The technical issue was due to the system not having a proper check and create flow implemented for the aliases, causing system failures when they did not exist. The concept of creating aliases in case they did not exist had not been implemented initially. 
A code update was implemented to include a check for aliases and create them if they did not exist. This involved modifying the system to initiate alias creation upon detecting their non-existence to ensure smooth operation and mitigate system failures.
Now, if an alias does not exist, the system automatically creates one, ensuring uninterrupted system performance and providing a more seamless user experience. This improvement is already in place for several users.
#### [fix: Fix Archiving for Opensearch](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3940)

Users experienced runtime timeouts due to the &#x60;ArchiverIT.shouldDeleteProcessInstanceRelatedData&#x60; being stuck.
This issue occurred due to a deficiency in the archiving process for Opensearch. 
The problem has been addressed by implementing a fix in the archiving code for Opensearch. Taking into account the test results that showed a decrease in the number of failed and skipped tests, this reaffirms the effectiveness of the fix administered.
With the application of this fix, users can expect the Opensearch archiving process to function correctly without causing any timeouts.
#### [fix: apply &#x60;rolloverBatchSize&#x60; when collecting instances to archive](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3452)

Users experienced an inefficient collection of instances to be archived, as the &#x60;rolloverBatchSize&#x60; parameter was not being correctly utilized. 
This issue arose due to the &#x60;rolloverBatchSize&#x60; not being applied when collecting instances for archiving in the software&#x27;s codebase. 
A change in the codebase ensured that the &#x60;rolloverBatchSize&#x60; is now correctly applied when collecting instances to be archived. 
The software now uses the &#x60;rolloverBatchSize&#x60; when collecting instances for archiving, enhancing the efficiency of this process.
#### [fix: return formId instead of null when has no form active](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3896)

The user was unable to handle 404 exceptions for getting forms on the process start by form which caused process inefficiencies. 
The system was programmed to return null when there was no active form. 
The code was modified to return the formId instead of null when there was no active form. 
Users can now handle the 404 exceptions for getting forms on Start Process by Form, improving process efficiency.
#### [fix: fixing AWS OpenSearch Connection](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3887)

Users were unable to integrate AWS OpenSearch into their workflow due to lack of support.
The system previously did not have support or integration for  AWS OpenSearch.
The software was updated to include AWS OpenSearch support.
Users can now leverage AWS OpenSearch within their processes effectively.

#### [fix: Prevent big forms from being cropped](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3818)

 Previously, users attempting to fill out large forms encountered an issue where part of the form was cut off from the visible screen area, preventing completion and submission.
 The form-rendering logic in the application didn&#x27;t account for form dimensions that exceeded the typical display size, resulting in the cropped forms.
 Adjustments were made to the form-rendering logic in order to accommodate large forms without losing any portion off the screen. This solution included updates in the system&#x27;s dynamic adjustment of the visible screen area based on the form&#x27;s dimensions.
 Currently, when users navigate to large forms, they are rendered correctly, fitting the visible screen area without any part being cut off, allowing for easy completion and submission.
#### [fix: Show error messages when variable fetch fails](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3778)

Users were not notified of failed variable requests, creating a lack of visibility and understanding when issues arose.
There was no mechanism in place to alert users when a variables request failed within the system.
Implemented an error message that is displayed whenever a variable request fails to provide immediate feedback to the user.
Users now see an error message whenever a variables request fails, improving their awareness and understanding of happens in the application.
#### [fix: extract the var retrieve from the loop + add log messages (#3817)](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3852)

 
Users were experiencing excessive program runtime with the logging feature in the previous version of our application.
 
In the engineering of the product, the variable retrieval operation was located inside the loop, causing unnecessary and repeated operations. Besides, the application lacked adequate log messages for effective debugging and traceability.
 
We made modifications in the product&#x27;s code. These changes included the extraction of the variable retrieval operation from the looping structure, which reduced the number of operations performed. In addition to this, we incorporated a series of log messages to enhance problem traceability.
 
With this fix in place, the application now runs more efficiently due to the optimized loop operation, resulting in improved execution time. Users are also now able to follow through the application&#x27;s process with the added log messages, facilitating an easier debugging process.
#### [fix: replace null string to object mapper node](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3848)

Previously, the frontend was unable to read null values marked with quotes. This unclear reading risked potential disruptions in user experience when interacting with the system.
The source of this issue was a past fix that was implemented to avoid nullpointer exceptions on the backend. The use of literal null strings (null enclosed in quotes) rather than actual null values precipitated this problem.
The implementation involved replacing the null string with an Object Mapper method, exploiting its ability to handle null nodes efficiently.
Now, the system can accurately interpret null values, consequently enhancing the frontend performance and ensuring a smoother user experience.
#### [fix: treat null values for forms in Tasks](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3755)

Tasks were not being processed correctly due to a bug that caused a NullPointer error when the system attempted to deserialize null JSON values. 
The issue was caused by the system failing when null JSON values were passed to the objectMapper method.
The system now checks if the variable value equals to &quot;null&quot;, if so, it returns the string &quot;null&quot; preventing the NullPointer error.
The system now correctly processes tasks even when null JSON values are present in the task forms, improving task processing and avoiding potential bugs related to nullable fields.
#### [fix: Update OpenSearchBulkProcessor.java version](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3777)

Users were experiencing suboptimal functioning of the system due to an outdated version of OpenSearchBulkProcessor.java.
The underlying cause of the issue was the use of an older version of OpenSearchBulkProcessor.java. 
We updated OpenSearchBulkProcessor.java to the version 8.4.
With the updated version of OpenSearchBulkProcessor.java, users should now experience improved performance and stability of the system.
#### [fix: auth0 claims](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3764)

Users were unable to find Auth0 Claims on SaaS environments, negatively impacting their ability to manage authentication and authorization processes.
In the engineering of the product, the wrong claim was used to seek Auth0 Claims. 
We rectified the claim used in the code to match the appropriate Auth0 Claim.
Now, users can correctly find Auth0 Claims on SaaS environments, enabling better management of authentication and authorization processes.
#### [fix: Fix start form submission error positioning](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3717)

Users experienced incorrect positioning of errors during form submission, causing confusion during error troubleshooting. 
The issue was due to a flaw in the form submission code, which caused system errors to appear in irrelevant positions.
The positioning of the form submission errors was corrected in the codebase. 
Any errors encountered when submitting forms now appear in their correct locations, making troubleshooting simpler and more intuitive.
#### [fix: add null check to extractTypedValue](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3721)

Users experienced a problem where the system was sending null values to the objectMapper, creating hurdles in instantiating &#x27;null&#x27; for JSON Objects. 
The system lacked a necessary null check in the extractTypedValue method of the ProcessService class.
The extractTypedValue method of the ProcessService class was updated with a null check. This change ensures that the system does not send null values to the objectMapper.
The system now correctly instantiates &#x27;null&#x27; for JSON Objects, eliminating the previous issues. The problem was also resolved on public start forms as they use the same process service to start the process instance.
#### [fix: update migration script](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3737)

Previously, users were experiencing issues during the data migration process, preventing a successful migration.
This problem occurred due to an outdated migration script which was not compatible with the current data schema.
We updated the migration script to match the current data schema, ensuring smooth data migration.
Now, users can seamlessly migrate their data with the updated migration script without encountering any issues.
#### [fix: [opensearch] Use aggregation by processDefinitionId and tenantId for process retrieval](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3642)

Users were bizarrely able to retrieve all processes, including ones they didn&#x27;t have authorization permissions for when a system with openSearch, RBA, and MT enabled was deployed. The web interface, Swagger, also demonstrated this issue by returning all processes instead of the ones with proper authorization.
The process retrieval code was not accounting for user-specific authorizations when openSearch and RBA were enabled simltaneously.
Implemented the use of Composite aggregation to gather buckets from bpmnProcessId and tenantId terms sources. Then, the top hits aggregation was added to get the most recent version for each (bpmnProcessId, tenantId) couple as was suggested in further discussion of the issue. This fix has been reported to run on OS and ES. Furthermore, an unrelated issue of RBA enabled users retrieving all processes was also treated in the same code patch.
Now, when running a process search without providing a tenantId in the request, processes with the highest version are returned for each tenant. This matches the expected behaviour. Also, when a user with RBA enabled tries to retrieve all processes, only the processes they have appropriate permissions for are returned.
#### [fix: fixing importer error when task retrieval fails](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3640)

Users previously experienced migration halting when an internal task on ElasticSearch failed.
The system was not adequately equipped to handle failures during the task retrieval process on ElasticSearch, causing the entire migration to stall.
We implemented a change to handle these internal task failures in ElasticSearch correctly, preventing a complete halt to migration when these incidents occur.
Users can now experience uninterrupted migration even when an internal task in ElasticSearch fails, improving the robustness and reliability of the system.
#### [fix: Set localhost for application.yml](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3633)

 Previously, the Elasticsearch configured was only recognized within the same Docker network, thereby causing the &#x60;make-env-up&#x60; commands to fail. 
 This was a result of setting the Elasticsearch (ES) address incorrectly. Instead of setting it to &#x60;localhost&#x60;, it was set to a different network.
 The issue was corrected by altering the Elasticsearch address to &#x60;localhost&#x60; within the &#x60;application.yml&#x60; configuration file. 
 Now, users can successfully execute the &#x60;make-env-up&#x60; command as the system properly recognizes the Elasticsearch on localhost.

#### [fix: close elasticsearchClient on tear down](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3628)

Previously, users experienced an interruption in system functionality when the application needed to tear down its Elasticsearch client, as the process wasn&#x27;t handled properly.
A flaw in the configuration and application management caused the system not to end the Elasticsearch client session correctly during tear down. This oversight could lead to performance issues and interrupted service during client restart or application shutdown.
The system issue was addressed by inserting an action to close the ElasticsearchClient during the tear down process. 
Now, when the application manages its Elasticsearch client, it smoothly handles the tear down process, allowing a more efficient system operation with no interruptions or degradation in performance.
#### [fix: Resource based auth is not checked when starting a process](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3611)

Previously, the system wasn&#x27;t checking resource-based authorization when initiating a process. This lack of security checks could have potentially allowed unauthenticated or unauthorized users to initiate processes.
The issue was rooted in the absence of resource-based authorization checks on the internal and external start process APIs and GraphQL process mutation.
The issue was addressed by implementing resource-based authorization checks on the mentioned components. This implementation impacted the internal start process API, external start process API and GraphQL process mutation.
Now, when starting a process, the system robustly checks resource-based authorization. This increases security and prevents unauthorized initiation of processes.
#### [fix: exiting application for schemaMigration](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3624)

The SchemaMigration process was failing to terminate successfully despite the completion of the SchemaMigration, causing a hang in the process.
The application lacked a way to signal the termination of the SchemaMigration process, thus restricting further continuation of the process.
Added a System.exit call in the code to signal the termination of the SchemaMigration process and allow the process to continue.
Now, successful completion of the SchemaMigration process results in its termination and continuation of the rest of the processes.
#### [fix: Only first 10 process are displayed in the processes tab](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3605)

 
Users were restricted to viewing only the first 10 processes in the processes tab.
The Elasticsearch aggregation utilized for fetching the most recent version process by tenantId/processId (to support the multi-tenancy feature) was only returning 10 buckets by default.
 
Elasticsearch was adjusted to return more buckets using aggregations size.
 
Users can now view more than 10 processes in the processes tab as the system now handles more than 10 results.
#### [fix: Improve error message when task is already asigned](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3589)

Users were encountering an unclear error message when attempting to assign a task that had already been assigned.
The backend was returning a generic error code when a task was already assigned to another user, and the error message was not properly consumed from the response. The frontend display was not adequately configured to handle and display this specific error response.
We updated the system to display &#x27;Task is already assigned&#x27; message when the backend returns this specific error code. The error message is now properly consumed from the response and reflected in the user-facing error message.
Now, when a task is already assigned to a different user, the system displays a clear error message stating &#x27;Task is already assigned&#x27;.
#### [fix: avoid running reindex when reindex is already running](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3608)

Users experienced a high load on ES when upgrading a large cluster due to multiple unnecessary reindexing processes. 
The tasklist scheduled multiple reindexes for the same index while a reindex was already running. 
A configuration update was made to avoid running a reindex for the same index when another reindex is already in progress.
Now, when a reindex is already running, an additional reindex for the same index will not be executed, reducing the load on ES during large cluster upgrades.
#### [fix: Fix JSON modal editor theme](https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/issues/3609)

 Users experienced a broken editor theme when using the JSON modal editor, impacting their ability to work efficiently within the system.
 A code error in the theme implementation caused the theme for the JSON modal editor to malfunction. 
 The developer identified and rectified the issue in the theme implementation, ensuring the editor theme was correctly applied.
 Users are now able to use the JSON modal editor without any issues, as the editor theme is functioning as intended.
