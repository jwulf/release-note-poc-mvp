    "bodyText": "Introduction\n\nKeep your running instances up-to-date with the latest process improvements (public roadmap issue).\nProcess Instance Migration is a feature that is available in Camunda 7 that allows process instances to be 'migrated' to another process model. Typically, this is useful when the process definition needs to be changed due to bugs or new requirements. This epic aims to add basic process instance migration functionality for relatively simple process definitions.\nEfforts on this feature start from lessons learned from the following issues, where we identified several potential iterations. However, that concept was overthrown after spiking another approach where we don't cancel the process instance and create a new instance using the target process definition, but rather adjust the existing process instance in such a way that the keys (process instance key, job keys, etc) remain the same:\n\n#11099\n#14960\n\nThis means that Process Instance Migration will allow users to migrate an existing process instance to a new process definition, but this will come with certain restrictions. For example, the type of an activity cannot be changed when mapping it in the migration plan.\nUsers can use Cancel Process Instance in combination with Create and Start at a User-Defined Element to overcome the limitations of Process Instance Migration, at the cost of losing the original process instance and a re-creation of the associated keys.\nRequirements and limitations\nProcess instances can only be migrated under the following requirements and limitations. The reasoning for each statement can be found by expanding the details.\nProcess instance migration can only migrate active process instances, i.e. existing process instances that have not yet been completed, terminated, or banned\n\nTerminated and completed process instances are removed from Zeebe, so Zeebe has no knowledge about them anymore.\nBanned process instances still exist in Zeebe. However, they are isolated from active instances so that they don't cause further damage. Banned instances cannot be recovered, but allow investigation by Zeebe developers to troubleshoot severe bugs.\n\n \nAll active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes)\n\nWe require all active elements in a process instance to have an explicit mapping in the migration plan. This is also a requirement for active Sub Processes.\nWhen a Sub Process is added nesting a mapped active element, the engine assumes that the user wants to have a new element instance of that Sub Process. Likewise, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element is removed, the engine could assume that the user wants to remove the element instance of that Sub Process. However, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, the user likely wants to reuse the element instance of the Sub Process. For example, if variables exist at this Sub Process, they wouldn't expect to lose them.\nNow consider the case where a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, but its element ID is changed. Should the engine consider this a different Sub Process from the active one, or does the user mean that this is the same Sub Process? There is no way for the engine to decide this for the user.\nTo highlight this, let's add one additional Sub Process to the target process nesting the Sub Process with the adjusted ID. In the example, we map Task A to A, what should happen to the instance of Sub Process Sub 1 and any variables existing on it?\n\n\nIf we recreate the Sub Process\n\nThe variables are lost\nOr the engine has to add logic to copy the variables automatically and choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3\n\n\nIf we adjust the Sub Process as Migrated\n\nThe engine has to choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3 as migration target and create an instance of the other\n\n\n\nIn both scenarios, the engine has to make a choice that it can't really make.\nThe alternative is to require users to provide a mapping for all active elements, including active Sub Processes. The engine can still assume to create new element instances for Sub Processes added to the hierarchy in the target process. When an active Sub Process is removed from the hierarchy, the user can provide an explicit mapping to:\n\na target Sub Process -> to migrate and keep the element instance\nno element \"\" (empty string) -> to terminate the element instance\n\nThis has several advantages:\n\nThe expected outcome of the migration plan is clear because the mappings are explicit\nIf the ID of a Sub Process is changed in a target process and the user forgets to map the Sub Process, it will otherwise lead to the loss of local variables existing at the Sub Process, or the engine has to make a choice for the user about copying the variables. This mistake could be easily made, so we should protect the user.\n\n\n \nMapping instructions cannot change the element type\n\nIf we would allow changing the element type, then type-specific expressions and entities may have to be created and/or removed depending on the mapping. This quickly leads to difficult situations.\nFor example, when mapping a service task to a user task, we'd have to remove the job, evaluate user-specific expressions (e.g. assignee), and create a new job with the new information, or adjust the existing job with the new info. If the type changes further from task to gateway, this also leads to more required changes. For Zeebe, it's best to keep this complexity under control and restrict how elements can be migrated.\nZeebe provides a way to move elements between elements of different types with the Process Instance Modification functionality. Users can modify and migrate a process instance in a two or three-step procedure:\n\nMigrate a process instance, keeping the active element unchanged and introducing a new element with a different type\nModify the process instance, moving the active element to the newly introduced element\nMigrate the process instance, removing the no longer needed element from the process\n\n\n \nThe target process definition must exist in Zeebe (deployed and not deleted)\n\nThis requirement should not raise any eyebrows. Zeebe must know what the target process looks like in order to migrate a process instance to it.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `sourceElementId` must refer to an element existing in the source process\n\nIf the mapping refers to a non-existing element id, then the user might have made a mistake in their mapping instructions. Instead of just accepting this, we prefer to point out the mistake. As process instance migration is a power tool, it's possible to damage a process instance. Therefore, we feel it's best to support the user wherever possible.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `targetElementId` must refer to an element existing in the target process (or refer to no element, i.e. `\"\"` empty string)\n\nExactly similar to the point above about sourceElementId, with one exception: if the mapping refers to a Sub Process, it's possible to remove the element instance by referring to no target element. See the discussion about All active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes) above.\n\n \nAdditional limitations\nThis epic will be limited as it only provides basic functionality and focuses on simpler process definitions. However, these are not requirements and may be changed later.\nThe number of active leaf element instances (i.e. tasks, events, gateways) stays the same\n\nWe may add support in future versions for removing or adding leaf element instances through specific mapping instructions, but we believe that this makes the feature unnecessarily complex. Users can use Process Instance Modification to remove or add element instances to a process instance and can combine it with Process Instance Migration in a multi-step procedure to deal with this. See the discussion on Mapping instructions cannot change the element type for an example of such a procedure changing step 2 to remove or add an element instance.\n\n\nConcept\nA new MigrateProcessInstance RPC will be added to Zeebe's Gateway to allow clients to migrate process instances. This RPC requires specifying a migration plan. This migration plan consists of mapping instructions specifying how active elements in the source process are migrated to elements in the target process.\nA simple migration example is migrating an active Service Task A to a process with that same Service Task A and a Service Task B after it. The mapping instructions specify that A is mapped to A. After the migration, the process instance is still waiting at Service Task A, and when completing its Job the process flows to Service Task B.\n\nReference-level details\n\nWe'll introduce a new MigrateProcessInstance RPC. This API allows for defining a migration plan consisting of a target process definition and a set of mapping instructions. Each instruction looks like [source element id -> target element id]. The RPC takes a MigrateProcessInstanceRequest similar to the following structure (note that the naming and structure are not yet definitive):\nmessage MigrateProcessInstanceRequest {\n  // key of process instance to migrate\n  int64 processInstanceKey = 1;\n\n  MigrationPlan migrationPlan = 2;\n\n  message MigrationPlan {\n    // the process definition key to migrate to\n    int64 targetProcessDefinitionKey = 1;\n    // source (to migrate from) element id and target element id (to migrate to)\n    repeated MappingInstruction mappingInstructions = 2;\n  }\n\n  message MappingInstruction {\n    // the element id to migrate from\n    string sourceElementId = 1;\n    // the element id to migrate to\n    string targetElementId = 2;\n  }\n}\nWhen migrating an instance, we adjust the active element instances in Zeebe's state using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. These make sure that the following information is updated:\n\nprocessDefinitionKey: the key of the target process definition\nbpmnProcessId: the BPMN ID of the target process definition\nversion: the version of the target process definition\nelementId: changes to the mapped element ID (note that the mapping may define the sourceElementId and the targetElementId as equivalent, in which case it stays the same)\nflowScopeKey: may change if the element exists within a different (sub)-process in the target process definition, e.g. when a new sub-process wraps the element or when a wrapping sub-process is removed in the diff between the source and target process definitions)\n\nSimilarly, we will adjust other entities:\n\njobs with Job:MIGRATED\nvariables with Variable:MIGRATED\nincidents with Incident:MIGRATED\n(eventually) event subscriptions like Timer:MIGRATED and SignalSubscription:MIGRATED, but these are kept out-of-scope initially by recreating event subscriptions\n\nIn the following example, both the element instance of the Process and the element instance of the active Service Task A are adjusted using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. The Job associated with Service Task A is also adjusted using a Job:MIGRATED event. If any Process Variables exist on the process instance, then these are adjusted using Variable:MIGRATED events.\n\nWe also need to adjust the internal entities (these exist in the state only and don't have their own associated records):\n\nEvent Scope Instance, requires changes to interrupting and boundary element ids\nEventTrigger, requires changes to elementId (but likely does not require adjustment for migrated instances)\n\nSuch internal entities can either:\n\nbe adjusted through the ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events\nbe promoted to have their own records so they can be adjusted through *:MIGRATED events\n\nNote that any entities introduced for new features will also need MIGRATED events to be adjusted. For example:\n\n#14938\n#14920\n#11217\n\nChanging the element hierarchy\nMigrated activities do not have to remain descendants of their closest migrating ancestor scope (Hierarchy Preservation) like in Camunda 7. Instead, a Sub Process can be added in the target process, nesting an element active in the source process. Zeebe will assume that the user intends to create a new element instance of the Sub Process that can be used as the ancestor scope of the active element.\nIn the following example, we see that element instance B is mapped to an element B that is nested inside A New Sub Process. A new element instance (with a new key) will be created for the element A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATING and ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATED. The flow scope (i.e. ancestor scope) of the element instance B is then adjusted to the key of the newly created instance of A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be added simultaneously.\n\nLikewise, a Sub Process in the source process may be removed in the target process. Zeebe will assume that the ancestor scope of the removed Sub Process instance can be used as the ancestor scope of any element active in that Sub Process.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be removed simultaneously.\n\nTask Breakdown #\n\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

variables of sub-processes when the scope hierarchy changes?\nIn Camunda7, there is a requirement for hierarchy preservation. It may be, that we don't have this same requirement in Zeebe. However, this lack presents ambiguity when it comes to copying variables of sub-processes.\nA potential solution would be introducing Variable Mapping Instructions to the Migration Plan, where the user can specify exactly where to move variables when removing a Sub Process from the hierarchy.\nThis functionality can be kept out of scope for now.\nHow should we deal with process instances in non-wait states?\nWhen the engine completes an element and flows to the next element, it:\n\nmarks the element as completed\nmarks the outgoing sequence flow as taken\nand appends a command to activate the next element for the process instance\n\nThis means that there are moments in time when an element is not active in the state. Rather the sequence flow is taken, and a not-yet-processed command describes the continuation of the process execution.\nAfter migrating the instance, such unprocessed commands will still be attempted to be processed, but they will be rejected because they refer to the now terminated source process instance.\nThis scenario also exists for Process Instance Modification, as the referenced process instance key stays the same for both modification and migration. However, parts of the process instance could be terminated, for which unprocessed commands could also be rejected.\nFor Process Instance Migration, other information (e.g. process definition key) has changed since the command was appended. What we could do to resolve this, is to never trust this data in ProcessInstance commands and always look up the current process definition by doing a lookup of the element instance by key. By trusting the state over the data in commands, we may be able to process more commands correctly.\nStill, an element activation command may be unprocessed targeting a no longer existing element id. In that case, the command will simply be rejected. The user may need to use Process Instance Modification to rectify the process instance state.\nThis scenario might not be too problematic, as it only affects non-wait states. Migration is typically done from wait state to wait state (e.g. user task to user task, service task to service task, etc), where the process has already reached that specific point and is awaiting further instructions from the client. For the cases where this affects non-wait states, modification can be used by the user to rectify any tokens lost during migration. In the future, process instance suspension may be used to stop process execution and increase the user's control over the process migration.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1470\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1829",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\n\nKeep your running instances up-to-date with the latest process improvements (public roadmap issue).\nProcess Instance Migration is a feature that is available in Camunda 7 that allows process instances to be 'migrated' to another process model. Typically, this is useful when the process definition needs to be changed due to bugs or new requirements. This epic aims to add basic process instance migration functionality for relatively simple process definitions.\nEfforts on this feature start from lessons learned from the following issues, where we identified several potential iterations. However, that concept was overthrown after spiking another approach where we don't cancel the process instance and create a new instance using the target process definition, but rather adjust the existing process instance in such a way that the keys (process instance key, job keys, etc) remain the same:\n\n#11099\n#14960\n\nThis means that Process Instance Migration will allow users to migrate an existing process instance to a new process definition, but this will come with certain restrictions. For example, the type of an activity cannot be changed when mapping it in the migration plan.\nUsers can use Cancel Process Instance in combination with Create and Start at a User-Defined Element to overcome the limitations of Process Instance Migration, at the cost of losing the original process instance and a re-creation of the associated keys.\nRequirements and limitations\nProcess instances can only be migrated under the following requirements and limitations. The reasoning for each statement can be found by expanding the details.\nProcess instance migration can only migrate active process instances, i.e. existing process instances that have not yet been completed, terminated, or banned\n\nTerminated and completed process instances are removed from Zeebe, so Zeebe has no knowledge about them anymore.\nBanned process instances still exist in Zeebe. However, they are isolated from active instances so that they don't cause further damage. Banned instances cannot be recovered, but allow investigation by Zeebe developers to troubleshoot severe bugs.\n\n \nAll active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes)\n\nWe require all active elements in a process instance to have an explicit mapping in the migration plan. This is also a requirement for active Sub Processes.\nWhen a Sub Process is added nesting a mapped active element, the engine assumes that the user wants to have a new element instance of that Sub Process. Likewise, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element is removed, the engine could assume that the user wants to remove the element instance of that Sub Process. However, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, the user likely wants to reuse the element instance of the Sub Process. For example, if variables exist at this Sub Process, they wouldn't expect to lose them.\nNow consider the case where a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, but its element ID is changed. Should the engine consider this a different Sub Process from the active one, or does the user mean that this is the same Sub Process? There is no way for the engine to decide this for the user.\nTo highlight this, let's add one additional Sub Process to the target process nesting the Sub Process with the adjusted ID. In the example, we map Task A to A, what should happen to the instance of Sub Process Sub 1 and any variables existing on it?\n\n\nIf we recreate the Sub Process\n\nThe variables are lost\nOr the engine has to add logic to copy the variables automatically and choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3\n\n\nIf we adjust the Sub Process as Migrated\n\nThe engine has to choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3 as migration target and create an instance of the other\n\n\n\nIn both scenarios, the engine has to make a choice that it can't really make.\nThe alternative is to require users to provide a mapping for all active elements, including active Sub Processes. The engine can still assume to create new element instances for Sub Processes added to the hierarchy in the target process. When an active Sub Process is removed from the hierarchy, the user can provide an explicit mapping to:\n\na target Sub Process -> to migrate and keep the element instance\nno element \"\" (empty string) -> to terminate the element instance\n\nThis has several advantages:\n\nThe expected outcome of the migration plan is clear because the mappings are explicit\nIf the ID of a Sub Process is changed in a target process and the user forgets to map the Sub Process, it will otherwise lead to the loss of local variables existing at the Sub Process, or the engine has to make a choice for the user about copying the variables. This mistake could be easily made, so we should protect the user.\n\n\n \nMapping instructions cannot change the element type\n\nIf we would allow changing the element type, then type-specific expressions and entities may have to be created and/or removed depending on the mapping. This quickly leads to difficult situations.\nFor example, when mapping a service task to a user task, we'd have to remove the job, evaluate user-specific expressions (e.g. assignee), and create a new job with the new information, or adjust the existing job with the new info. If the type changes further from task to gateway, this also leads to more required changes. For Zeebe, it's best to keep this complexity under control and restrict how elements can be migrated.\nZeebe provides a way to move elements between elements of different types with the Process Instance Modification functionality. Users can modify and migrate a process instance in a two or three-step procedure:\n\nMigrate a process instance, keeping the active element unchanged and introducing a new element with a different type\nModify the process instance, moving the active element to the newly introduced element\nMigrate the process instance, removing the no longer needed element from the process\n\n\n \nThe target process definition must exist in Zeebe (deployed and not deleted)\n\nThis requirement should not raise any eyebrows. Zeebe must know what the target process looks like in order to migrate a process instance to it.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `sourceElementId` must refer to an element existing in the source process\n\nIf the mapping refers to a non-existing element id, then the user might have made a mistake in their mapping instructions. Instead of just accepting this, we prefer to point out the mistake. As process instance migration is a power tool, it's possible to damage a process instance. Therefore, we feel it's best to support the user wherever possible.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `targetElementId` must refer to an element existing in the target process (or refer to no element, i.e. `\"\"` empty string)\n\nExactly similar to the point above about sourceElementId, with one exception: if the mapping refers to a Sub Process, it's possible to remove the element instance by referring to no target element. See the discussion about All active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes) above.\n\n \nAdditional limitations\nThis epic will be limited as it only provides basic functionality and focuses on simpler process definitions. However, these are not requirements and may be changed later.\nThe number of active leaf element instances (i.e. tasks, events, gateways) stays the same\n\nWe may add support in future versions for removing or adding leaf element instances through specific mapping instructions, but we believe that this makes the feature unnecessarily complex. Users can use Process Instance Modification to remove or add element instances to a process instance and can combine it with Process Instance Migration in a multi-step procedure to deal with this. See the discussion on Mapping instructions cannot change the element type for an example of such a procedure changing step 2 to remove or add an element instance.\n\n\nConcept\nA new MigrateProcessInstance RPC will be added to Zeebe's Gateway to allow clients to migrate process instances. This RPC requires specifying a migration plan. This migration plan consists of mapping instructions specifying how active elements in the source process are migrated to elements in the target process.\nA simple migration example is migrating an active Service Task A to a process with that same Service Task A and a Service Task B after it. The mapping instructions specify that A is mapped to A. After the migration, the process instance is still waiting at Service Task A, and when completing its Job the process flows to Service Task B.\n\nReference-level details\n\nWe'll introduce a new MigrateProcessInstance RPC. This API allows for defining a migration plan consisting of a target process definition and a set of mapping instructions. Each instruction looks like [source element id -> target element id]. The RPC takes a MigrateProcessInstanceRequest similar to the following structure (note that the naming and structure are not yet definitive):\nmessage MigrateProcessInstanceRequest {\n  // key of process instance to migrate\n  int64 processInstanceKey = 1;\n\n  MigrationPlan migrationPlan = 2;\n\n  message MigrationPlan {\n    // the process definition key to migrate to\n    int64 targetProcessDefinitionKey = 1;\n    // source (to migrate from) element id and target element id (to migrate to)\n    repeated MappingInstruction mappingInstructions = 2;\n  }\n\n  message MappingInstruction {\n    // the element id to migrate from\n    string sourceElementId = 1;\n    // the element id to migrate to\n    string targetElementId = 2;\n  }\n}\nWhen migrating an instance, we adjust the active element instances in Zeebe's state using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. These make sure that the following information is updated:\n\nprocessDefinitionKey: the key of the target process definition\nbpmnProcessId: the BPMN ID of the target process definition\nversion: the version of the target process definition\nelementId: changes to the mapped element ID (note that the mapping may define the sourceElementId and the targetElementId as equivalent, in which case it stays the same)\nflowScopeKey: may change if the element exists within a different (sub)-process in the target process definition, e.g. when a new sub-process wraps the element or when a wrapping sub-process is removed in the diff between the source and target process definitions)\n\nSimilarly, we will adjust other entities:\n\njobs with Job:MIGRATED\nvariables with Variable:MIGRATED\nincidents with Incident:MIGRATED\n(eventually) event subscriptions like Timer:MIGRATED and SignalSubscription:MIGRATED, but these are kept out-of-scope initially by recreating event subscriptions\n\nIn the following example, both the element instance of the Process and the element instance of the active Service Task A are adjusted using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. The Job associated with Service Task A is also adjusted using a Job:MIGRATED event. If any Process Variables exist on the process instance, then these are adjusted using Variable:MIGRATED events.\n\nWe also need to adjust the internal entities (these exist in the state only and don't have their own associated records):\n\nEvent Scope Instance, requires changes to interrupting and boundary element ids\nEventTrigger, requires changes to elementId (but likely does not require adjustment for migrated instances)\n\nSuch internal entities can either:\n\nbe adjusted through the ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events\nbe promoted to have their own records so they can be adjusted through *:MIGRATED events\n\nNote that any entities introduced for new features will also need MIGRATED events to be adjusted. For example:\n\n#14938\n#14920\n#11217\n\nChanging the element hierarchy\nMigrated activities do not have to remain descendants of their closest migrating ancestor scope (Hierarchy Preservation) like in Camunda 7. Instead, a Sub Process can be added in the target process, nesting an element active in the source process. Zeebe will assume that the user intends to create a new element instance of the Sub Process that can be used as the ancestor scope of the active element.\nIn the following example, we see that element instance B is mapped to an element B that is nested inside A New Sub Process. A new element instance (with a new key) will be created for the element A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATING and ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATED. The flow scope (i.e. ancestor scope) of the element instance B is then adjusted to the key of the newly created instance of A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be added simultaneously.\n\nLikewise, a Sub Process in the source process may be removed in the target process. Zeebe will assume that the ancestor scope of the removed Sub Process instance can be used as the ancestor scope of any element active in that Sub Process.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be removed simultaneously.\n\nTask Breakdown #\n\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

variables of sub-processes when the scope hierarchy changes?\nIn Camunda7, there is a requirement for hierarchy preservation. It may be, that we don't have this same requirement in Zeebe. However, this lack presents ambiguity when it comes to copying variables of sub-processes.\nA potential solution would be introducing Variable Mapping Instructions to the Migration Plan, where the user can specify exactly where to move variables when removing a Sub Process from the hierarchy.\nThis functionality can be kept out of scope for now.\nHow should we deal with process instances in non-wait states?\nWhen the engine completes an element and flows to the next element, it:\n\nmarks the element as completed\nmarks the outgoing sequence flow as taken\nand appends a command to activate the next element for the process instance\n\nThis means that there are moments in time when an element is not active in the state. Rather the sequence flow is taken, and a not-yet-processed command describes the continuation of the process execution.\nAfter migrating the instance, such unprocessed commands will still be attempted to be processed, but they will be rejected because they refer to the now terminated source process instance.\nThis scenario also exists for Process Instance Modification, as the referenced process instance key stays the same for both modification and migration. However, parts of the process instance could be terminated, for which unprocessed commands could also be rejected.\nFor Process Instance Migration, other information (e.g. process definition key) has changed since the command was appended. What we could do to resolve this, is to never trust this data in ProcessInstance commands and always look up the current process definition by doing a lookup of the element instance by key. By trusting the state over the data in commands, we may be able to process more commands correctly.\nStill, an element activation command may be unprocessed targeting a no longer existing element id. In that case, the command will simply be rejected. The user may need to use Process Instance Modification to rectify the process instance state.\nThis scenario might not be too problematic, as it only affects non-wait states. Migration is typically done from wait state to wait state (e.g. user task to user task, service task to service task, etc), where the process has already reached that specific point and is awaiting further instructions from the client. For the cases where this affects non-wait states, modification can be used by the user to rectify any tokens lost during migration. In the future, process instance suspension may be used to stop process execution and increase the user's control over the process migration.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1470\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1829",

like process instances and jobs. The intention is to provide multi-tenancy support for these concepts early in the implementation so that other Camunda Platform 8 components are unblocked, and can start implementing multi-tenancy on their side as well.\nEach task of phase 2 covers the vertical implementation (engine, gateway, client, data migration, documentation) for a Zeebe concept. The vertical implementation of the deployments functionality can serve as an example.\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

    "bodyText": "Introduction\n\nKeep your running instances up-to-date with the latest process improvements (public roadmap issue).\nProcess Instance Migration is a feature that is available in Camunda 7 that allows process instances to be 'migrated' to another process model. Typically, this is useful when the process definition needs to be changed due to bugs or new requirements. This epic aims to add basic process instance migration functionality for relatively simple process definitions.\nEfforts on this feature start from lessons learned from the following issues, where we identified several potential iterations. However, that concept was overthrown after spiking another approach where we don't cancel the process instance and create a new instance using the target process definition, but rather adjust the existing process instance in such a way that the keys (process instance key, job keys, etc) remain the same:\n\n#11099\n#14960\n\nThis means that Process Instance Migration will allow users to migrate an existing process instance to a new process definition, but this will come with certain restrictions. For example, the type of an activity cannot be changed when mapping it in the migration plan.\nUsers can use Cancel Process Instance in combination with Create and Start at a User-Defined Element to overcome the limitations of Process Instance Migration, at the cost of losing the original process instance and a re-creation of the associated keys.\nRequirements and limitations\nProcess instances can only be migrated under the following requirements and limitations. The reasoning for each statement can be found by expanding the details.\nProcess instance migration can only migrate active process instances, i.e. existing process instances that have not yet been completed, terminated, or banned\n\nTerminated and completed process instances are removed from Zeebe, so Zeebe has no knowledge about them anymore.\nBanned process instances still exist in Zeebe. However, they are isolated from active instances so that they don't cause further damage. Banned instances cannot be recovered, but allow investigation by Zeebe developers to troubleshoot severe bugs.\n\n \nAll active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes)\n\nWe require all active elements in a process instance to have an explicit mapping in the migration plan. This is also a requirement for active Sub Processes.\nWhen a Sub Process is added nesting a mapped active element, the engine assumes that the user wants to have a new element instance of that Sub Process. Likewise, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element is removed, the engine could assume that the user wants to remove the element instance of that Sub Process. However, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, the user likely wants to reuse the element instance of the Sub Process. For example, if variables exist at this Sub Process, they wouldn't expect to lose them.\nNow consider the case where a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, but its element ID is changed. Should the engine consider this a different Sub Process from the active one, or does the user mean that this is the same Sub Process? There is no way for the engine to decide this for the user.\nTo highlight this, let's add one additional Sub Process to the target process nesting the Sub Process with the adjusted ID. In the example, we map Task A to A, what should happen to the instance of Sub Process Sub 1 and any variables existing on it?\n\n\nIf we recreate the Sub Process\n\nThe variables are lost\nOr the engine has to add logic to copy the variables automatically and choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3\n\n\nIf we adjust the Sub Process as Migrated\n\nThe engine has to choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3 as migration target and create an instance of the other\n\n\n\nIn both scenarios, the engine has to make a choice that it can't really make.\nThe alternative is to require users to provide a mapping for all active elements, including active Sub Processes. The engine can still assume to create new element instances for Sub Processes added to the hierarchy in the target process. When an active Sub Process is removed from the hierarchy, the user can provide an explicit mapping to:\n\na target Sub Process -> to migrate and keep the element instance\nno element \"\" (empty string) -> to terminate the element instance\n\nThis has several advantages:\n\nThe expected outcome of the migration plan is clear because the mappings are explicit\nIf the ID of a Sub Process is changed in a target process and the user forgets to map the Sub Process, it will otherwise lead to the loss of local variables existing at the Sub Process, or the engine has to make a choice for the user about copying the variables. This mistake could be easily made, so we should protect the user.\n\n\n \nMapping instructions cannot change the element type\n\nIf we would allow changing the element type, then type-specific expressions and entities may have to be created and/or removed depending on the mapping. This quickly leads to difficult situations.\nFor example, when mapping a service task to a user task, we'd have to remove the job, evaluate user-specific expressions (e.g. assignee), and create a new job with the new information, or adjust the existing job with the new info. If the type changes further from task to gateway, this also leads to more required changes. For Zeebe, it's best to keep this complexity under control and restrict how elements can be migrated.\nZeebe provides a way to move elements between elements of different types with the Process Instance Modification functionality. Users can modify and migrate a process instance in a two or three-step procedure:\n\nMigrate a process instance, keeping the active element unchanged and introducing a new element with a different type\nModify the process instance, moving the active element to the newly introduced element\nMigrate the process instance, removing the no longer needed element from the process\n\n\n \nThe target process definition must exist in Zeebe (deployed and not deleted)\n\nThis requirement should not raise any eyebrows. Zeebe must know what the target process looks like in order to migrate a process instance to it.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `sourceElementId` must refer to an element existing in the source process\n\nIf the mapping refers to a non-existing element id, then the user might have made a mistake in their mapping instructions. Instead of just accepting this, we prefer to point out the mistake. As process instance migration is a power tool, it's possible to damage a process instance. Therefore, we feel it's best to support the user wherever possible.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `targetElementId` must refer to an element existing in the target process (or refer to no element, i.e. `\"\"` empty string)\n\nExactly similar to the point above about sourceElementId, with one exception: if the mapping refers to a Sub Process, it's possible to remove the element instance by referring to no target element. See the discussion about All active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes) above.\n\n \nAdditional limitations\nThis epic will be limited as it only provides basic functionality and focuses on simpler process definitions. However, these are not requirements and may be changed later.\nThe number of active leaf element instances (i.e. tasks, events, gateways) stays the same\n\nWe may add support in future versions for removing or adding leaf element instances through specific mapping instructions, but we believe that this makes the feature unnecessarily complex. Users can use Process Instance Modification to remove or add element instances to a process instance and can combine it with Process Instance Migration in a multi-step procedure to deal with this. See the discussion on Mapping instructions cannot change the element type for an example of such a procedure changing step 2 to remove or add an element instance.\n\n\nConcept\nA new MigrateProcessInstance RPC will be added to Zeebe's Gateway to allow clients to migrate process instances. This RPC requires specifying a migration plan. This migration plan consists of mapping instructions specifying how active elements in the source process are migrated to elements in the target process.\nA simple migration example is migrating an active Service Task A to a process with that same Service Task A and a Service Task B after it. The mapping instructions specify that A is mapped to A. After the migration, the process instance is still waiting at Service Task A, and when completing its Job the process flows to Service Task B.\n\nReference-level details\n\nWe'll introduce a new MigrateProcessInstance RPC. This API allows for defining a migration plan consisting of a target process definition and a set of mapping instructions. Each instruction looks like [source element id -> target element id]. The RPC takes a MigrateProcessInstanceRequest similar to the following structure (note that the naming and structure are not yet definitive):\nmessage MigrateProcessInstanceRequest {\n  // key of process instance to migrate\n  int64 processInstanceKey = 1;\n\n  MigrationPlan migrationPlan = 2;\n\n  message MigrationPlan {\n    // the process definition key to migrate to\n    int64 targetProcessDefinitionKey = 1;\n    // source (to migrate from) element id and target element id (to migrate to)\n    repeated MappingInstruction mappingInstructions = 2;\n  }\n\n  message MappingInstruction {\n    // the element id to migrate from\n    string sourceElementId = 1;\n    // the element id to migrate to\n    string targetElementId = 2;\n  }\n}\nWhen migrating an instance, we adjust the active element instances in Zeebe's state using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. These make sure that the following information is updated:\n\nprocessDefinitionKey: the key of the target process definition\nbpmnProcessId: the BPMN ID of the target process definition\nversion: the version of the target process definition\nelementId: changes to the mapped element ID (note that the mapping may define the sourceElementId and the targetElementId as equivalent, in which case it stays the same)\nflowScopeKey: may change if the element exists within a different (sub)-process in the target process definition, e.g. when a new sub-process wraps the element or when a wrapping sub-process is removed in the diff between the source and target process definitions)\n\nSimilarly, we will adjust other entities:\n\njobs with Job:MIGRATED\nvariables with Variable:MIGRATED\nincidents with Incident:MIGRATED\n(eventually) event subscriptions like Timer:MIGRATED and SignalSubscription:MIGRATED, but these are kept out-of-scope initially by recreating event subscriptions\n\nIn the following example, both the element instance of the Process and the element instance of the active Service Task A are adjusted using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. The Job associated with Service Task A is also adjusted using a Job:MIGRATED event. If any Process Variables exist on the process instance, then these are adjusted using Variable:MIGRATED events.\n\nWe also need to adjust the internal entities (these exist in the state only and don't have their own associated records):\n\nEvent Scope Instance, requires changes to interrupting and boundary element ids\nEventTrigger, requires changes to elementId (but likely does not require adjustment for migrated instances)\n\nSuch internal entities can either:\n\nbe adjusted through the ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events\nbe promoted to have their own records so they can be adjusted through *:MIGRATED events\n\nNote that any entities introduced for new features will also need MIGRATED events to be adjusted. For example:\n\n#14938\n#14920\n#11217\n\nChanging the element hierarchy\nMigrated activities do not have to remain descendants of their closest migrating ancestor scope (Hierarchy Preservation) like in Camunda 7. Instead, a Sub Process can be added in the target process, nesting an element active in the source process. Zeebe will assume that the user intends to create a new element instance of the Sub Process that can be used as the ancestor scope of the active element.\nIn the following example, we see that element instance B is mapped to an element B that is nested inside A New Sub Process. A new element instance (with a new key) will be created for the element A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATING and ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATED. The flow scope (i.e. ancestor scope) of the element instance B is then adjusted to the key of the newly created instance of A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be added simultaneously.\n\nLikewise, a Sub Process in the source process may be removed in the target process. Zeebe will assume that the ancestor scope of the removed Sub Process instance can be used as the ancestor scope of any element active in that Sub Process.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be removed simultaneously.\n\nTask Breakdown #\n\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

variables of sub-processes when the scope hierarchy changes?\nIn Camunda7, there is a requirement for hierarchy preservation. It may be, that we don't have this same requirement in Zeebe. However, this lack presents ambiguity when it comes to copying variables of sub-processes.\nA potential solution would be introducing Variable Mapping Instructions to the Migration Plan, where the user can specify exactly where to move variables when removing a Sub Process from the hierarchy.\nThis functionality can be kept out of scope for now.\nHow should we deal with process instances in non-wait states?\nWhen the engine completes an element and flows to the next element, it:\n\nmarks the element as completed\nmarks the outgoing sequence flow as taken\nand appends a command to activate the next element for the process instance\n\nThis means that there are moments in time when an element is not active in the state. Rather the sequence flow is taken, and a not-yet-processed command describes the continuation of the process execution.\nAfter migrating the instance, such unprocessed commands will still be attempted to be processed, but they will be rejected because they refer to the now terminated source process instance.\nThis scenario also exists for Process Instance Modification, as the referenced process instance key stays the same for both modification and migration. However, parts of the process instance could be terminated, for which unprocessed commands could also be rejected.\nFor Process Instance Migration, other information (e.g. process definition key) has changed since the command was appended. What we could do to resolve this, is to never trust this data in ProcessInstance commands and always look up the current process definition by doing a lookup of the element instance by key. By trusting the state over the data in commands, we may be able to process more commands correctly.\nStill, an element activation command may be unprocessed targeting a no longer existing element id. In that case, the command will simply be rejected. The user may need to use Process Instance Modification to rectify the process instance state.\nThis scenario might not be too problematic, as it only affects non-wait states. Migration is typically done from wait state to wait state (e.g. user task to user task, service task to service task, etc), where the process has already reached that specific point and is awaiting further instructions from the client. For the cases where this affects non-wait states, modification can be used by the user to rectify any tokens lost during migration. In the future, process instance suspension may be used to stop process execution and increase the user's control over the process migration.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1470\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1829",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\n\nKeep your running instances up-to-date with the latest process improvements (public roadmap issue).\nProcess Instance Migration is a feature that is available in Camunda 7 that allows process instances to be 'migrated' to another process model. Typically, this is useful when the process definition needs to be changed due to bugs or new requirements. This epic aims to add basic process instance migration functionality for relatively simple process definitions.\nEfforts on this feature start from lessons learned from the following issues, where we identified several potential iterations. However, that concept was overthrown after spiking another approach where we don't cancel the process instance and create a new instance using the target process definition, but rather adjust the existing process instance in such a way that the keys (process instance key, job keys, etc) remain the same:\n\n#11099\n#14960\n\nThis means that Process Instance Migration will allow users to migrate an existing process instance to a new process definition, but this will come with certain restrictions. For example, the type of an activity cannot be changed when mapping it in the migration plan.\nUsers can use Cancel Process Instance in combination with Create and Start at a User-Defined Element to overcome the limitations of Process Instance Migration, at the cost of losing the original process instance and a re-creation of the associated keys.\nRequirements and limitations\nProcess instances can only be migrated under the following requirements and limitations. The reasoning for each statement can be found by expanding the details.\nProcess instance migration can only migrate active process instances, i.e. existing process instances that have not yet been completed, terminated, or banned\n\nTerminated and completed process instances are removed from Zeebe, so Zeebe has no knowledge about them anymore.\nBanned process instances still exist in Zeebe. However, they are isolated from active instances so that they don't cause further damage. Banned instances cannot be recovered, but allow investigation by Zeebe developers to troubleshoot severe bugs.\n\n \nAll active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes)\n\nWe require all active elements in a process instance to have an explicit mapping in the migration plan. This is also a requirement for active Sub Processes.\nWhen a Sub Process is added nesting a mapped active element, the engine assumes that the user wants to have a new element instance of that Sub Process. Likewise, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element is removed, the engine could assume that the user wants to remove the element instance of that Sub Process. However, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, the user likely wants to reuse the element instance of the Sub Process. For example, if variables exist at this Sub Process, they wouldn't expect to lose them.\nNow consider the case where a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, but its element ID is changed. Should the engine consider this a different Sub Process from the active one, or does the user mean that this is the same Sub Process? There is no way for the engine to decide this for the user.\nTo highlight this, let's add one additional Sub Process to the target process nesting the Sub Process with the adjusted ID. In the example, we map Task A to A, what should happen to the instance of Sub Process Sub 1 and any variables existing on it?\n\n\nIf we recreate the Sub Process\n\nThe variables are lost\nOr the engine has to add logic to copy the variables automatically and choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3\n\n\nIf we adjust the Sub Process as Migrated\n\nThe engine has to choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3 as migration target and create an instance of the other\n\n\n\nIn both scenarios, the engine has to make a choice that it can't really make.\nThe alternative is to require users to provide a mapping for all active elements, including active Sub Processes. The engine can still assume to create new element instances for Sub Processes added to the hierarchy in the target process. When an active Sub Process is removed from the hierarchy, the user can provide an explicit mapping to:\n\na target Sub Process -> to migrate and keep the element instance\nno element \"\" (empty string) -> to terminate the element instance\n\nThis has several advantages:\n\nThe expected outcome of the migration plan is clear because the mappings are explicit\nIf the ID of a Sub Process is changed in a target process and the user forgets to map the Sub Process, it will otherwise lead to the loss of local variables existing at the Sub Process, or the engine has to make a choice for the user about copying the variables. This mistake could be easily made, so we should protect the user.\n\n\n \nMapping instructions cannot change the element type\n\nIf we would allow changing the element type, then type-specific expressions and entities may have to be created and/or removed depending on the mapping. This quickly leads to difficult situations.\nFor example, when mapping a service task to a user task, we'd have to remove the job, evaluate user-specific expressions (e.g. assignee), and create a new job with the new information, or adjust the existing job with the new info. If the type changes further from task to gateway, this also leads to more required changes. For Zeebe, it's best to keep this complexity under control and restrict how elements can be migrated.\nZeebe provides a way to move elements between elements of different types with the Process Instance Modification functionality. Users can modify and migrate a process instance in a two or three-step procedure:\n\nMigrate a process instance, keeping the active element unchanged and introducing a new element with a different type\nModify the process instance, moving the active element to the newly introduced element\nMigrate the process instance, removing the no longer needed element from the process\n\n\n \nThe target process definition must exist in Zeebe (deployed and not deleted)\n\nThis requirement should not raise any eyebrows. Zeebe must know what the target process looks like in order to migrate a process instance to it.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `sourceElementId` must refer to an element existing in the source process\n\nIf the mapping refers to a non-existing element id, then the user might have made a mistake in their mapping instructions. Instead of just accepting this, we prefer to point out the mistake. As process instance migration is a power tool, it's possible to damage a process instance. Therefore, we feel it's best to support the user wherever possible.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `targetElementId` must refer to an element existing in the target process (or refer to no element, i.e. `\"\"` empty string)\n\nExactly similar to the point above about sourceElementId, with one exception: if the mapping refers to a Sub Process, it's possible to remove the element instance by referring to no target element. See the discussion about All active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes) above.\n\n \nAdditional limitations\nThis epic will be limited as it only provides basic functionality and focuses on simpler process definitions. However, these are not requirements and may be changed later.\nThe number of active leaf element instances (i.e. tasks, events, gateways) stays the same\n\nWe may add support in future versions for removing or adding leaf element instances through specific mapping instructions, but we believe that this makes the feature unnecessarily complex. Users can use Process Instance Modification to remove or add element instances to a process instance and can combine it with Process Instance Migration in a multi-step procedure to deal with this. See the discussion on Mapping instructions cannot change the element type for an example of such a procedure changing step 2 to remove or add an element instance.\n\n\nConcept\nA new MigrateProcessInstance RPC will be added to Zeebe's Gateway to allow clients to migrate process instances. This RPC requires specifying a migration plan. This migration plan consists of mapping instructions specifying how active elements in the source process are migrated to elements in the target process.\nA simple migration example is migrating an active Service Task A to a process with that same Service Task A and a Service Task B after it. The mapping instructions specify that A is mapped to A. After the migration, the process instance is still waiting at Service Task A, and when completing its Job the process flows to Service Task B.\n\nReference-level details\n\nWe'll introduce a new MigrateProcessInstance RPC. This API allows for defining a migration plan consisting of a target process definition and a set of mapping instructions. Each instruction looks like [source element id -> target element id]. The RPC takes a MigrateProcessInstanceRequest similar to the following structure (note that the naming and structure are not yet definitive):\nmessage MigrateProcessInstanceRequest {\n  // key of process instance to migrate\n  int64 processInstanceKey = 1;\n\n  MigrationPlan migrationPlan = 2;\n\n  message MigrationPlan {\n    // the process definition key to migrate to\n    int64 targetProcessDefinitionKey = 1;\n    // source (to migrate from) element id and target element id (to migrate to)\n    repeated MappingInstruction mappingInstructions = 2;\n  }\n\n  message MappingInstruction {\n    // the element id to migrate from\n    string sourceElementId = 1;\n    // the element id to migrate to\n    string targetElementId = 2;\n  }\n}\nWhen migrating an instance, we adjust the active element instances in Zeebe's state using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. These make sure that the following information is updated:\n\nprocessDefinitionKey: the key of the target process definition\nbpmnProcessId: the BPMN ID of the target process definition\nversion: the version of the target process definition\nelementId: changes to the mapped element ID (note that the mapping may define the sourceElementId and the targetElementId as equivalent, in which case it stays the same)\nflowScopeKey: may change if the element exists within a different (sub)-process in the target process definition, e.g. when a new sub-process wraps the element or when a wrapping sub-process is removed in the diff between the source and target process definitions)\n\nSimilarly, we will adjust other entities:\n\njobs with Job:MIGRATED\nvariables with Variable:MIGRATED\nincidents with Incident:MIGRATED\n(eventually) event subscriptions like Timer:MIGRATED and SignalSubscription:MIGRATED, but these are kept out-of-scope initially by recreating event subscriptions\n\nIn the following example, both the element instance of the Process and the element instance of the active Service Task A are adjusted using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. The Job associated with Service Task A is also adjusted using a Job:MIGRATED event. If any Process Variables exist on the process instance, then these are adjusted using Variable:MIGRATED events.\n\nWe also need to adjust the internal entities (these exist in the state only and don't have their own associated records):\n\nEvent Scope Instance, requires changes to interrupting and boundary element ids\nEventTrigger, requires changes to elementId (but likely does not require adjustment for migrated instances)\n\nSuch internal entities can either:\n\nbe adjusted through the ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events\nbe promoted to have their own records so they can be adjusted through *:MIGRATED events\n\nNote that any entities introduced for new features will also need MIGRATED events to be adjusted. For example:\n\n#14938\n#14920\n#11217\n\nChanging the element hierarchy\nMigrated activities do not have to remain descendants of their closest migrating ancestor scope (Hierarchy Preservation) like in Camunda 7. Instead, a Sub Process can be added in the target process, nesting an element active in the source process. Zeebe will assume that the user intends to create a new element instance of the Sub Process that can be used as the ancestor scope of the active element.\nIn the following example, we see that element instance B is mapped to an element B that is nested inside A New Sub Process. A new element instance (with a new key) will be created for the element A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATING and ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATED. The flow scope (i.e. ancestor scope) of the element instance B is then adjusted to the key of the newly created instance of A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be added simultaneously.\n\nLikewise, a Sub Process in the source process may be removed in the target process. Zeebe will assume that the ancestor scope of the removed Sub Process instance can be used as the ancestor scope of any element active in that Sub Process.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be removed simultaneously.\n\nTask Breakdown #\n\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

variables of sub-processes when the scope hierarchy changes?\nIn Camunda7, there is a requirement for hierarchy preservation. It may be, that we don't have this same requirement in Zeebe. However, this lack presents ambiguity when it comes to copying variables of sub-processes.\nA potential solution would be introducing Variable Mapping Instructions to the Migration Plan, where the user can specify exactly where to move variables when removing a Sub Process from the hierarchy.\nThis functionality can be kept out of scope for now.\nHow should we deal with process instances in non-wait states?\nWhen the engine completes an element and flows to the next element, it:\n\nmarks the element as completed\nmarks the outgoing sequence flow as taken\nand appends a command to activate the next element for the process instance\n\nThis means that there are moments in time when an element is not active in the state. Rather the sequence flow is taken, and a not-yet-processed command describes the continuation of the process execution.\nAfter migrating the instance, such unprocessed commands will still be attempted to be processed, but they will be rejected because they refer to the now terminated source process instance.\nThis scenario also exists for Process Instance Modification, as the referenced process instance key stays the same for both modification and migration. However, parts of the process instance could be terminated, for which unprocessed commands could also be rejected.\nFor Process Instance Migration, other information (e.g. process definition key) has changed since the command was appended. What we could do to resolve this, is to never trust this data in ProcessInstance commands and always look up the current process definition by doing a lookup of the element instance by key. By trusting the state over the data in commands, we may be able to process more commands correctly.\nStill, an element activation command may be unprocessed targeting a no longer existing element id. In that case, the command will simply be rejected. The user may need to use Process Instance Modification to rectify the process instance state.\nThis scenario might not be too problematic, as it only affects non-wait states. Migration is typically done from wait state to wait state (e.g. user task to user task, service task to service task, etc), where the process has already reached that specific point and is awaiting further instructions from the client. For the cases where this affects non-wait states, modification can be used by the user to rectify any tokens lost during migration. In the future, process instance suspension may be used to stop process execution and increase the user's control over the process migration.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1470\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1829",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nFeature name\n⚠️ We don't like to name this feature extend job lock. First of all, it's not only used for extending. With this feature we will also support reducing the timeout of a Job, which we see as a valid use case. This is also something that's supported in C7. So instead of extend, we chose to call it updating.\nSecond, we don't have a locking mechanism in C8 as we do in C7. Therefore we don't want lock to be part of the name. We have never referred to Jobs as being locked in C8 and introducing this term now could cause confusion for users. Instead, we decided to go with timeout. This a term that users are already familiar with when working with job activations. So instead of job lock, we chose to call it job timeout.\nTl;dr we chose to name the topic Update Job Timeout as opposed to Job Extend Lock.\nSummary\n\nThere are jobs which have an elastic timespan, meaning they can run for 5 minutes, but can be also 24+ hours. For example in some projects there can be a lot of long-running background processes (duration is from several seconds to multiple hours and sometimes days).\nThe problem is that the workers picking up the jobs do not know in advance how long the given process take thus they can't accurately estimate a timeout.\nIn order to determine if a job is still OK, even though it takes a while, the job needs to extend the lock or update the timeout threshold. Using extremely long timeouts is no good idea, because then it can not be determined if a job failed a job.\nConcept\n\nWhat does it look like in the state?\nWhen a Job Worker activates a Job it can specify a timeout for how long the Job should remain activated (default: 5 minutes). In Zeebe we call this the deadline of the Job.\nIn the state 2 important changes are made when this happens:\n\nThe Job is removed from the JOB_ACTIVATABLE ColumnFamily\n\nThis makes it so no other Job Workers can activate the Job\n\n\nThe Job is added to the JOB_DEADLINES ColumnFamily\n\nThis ColumnFamily keeps track of the timestamp on which a Job activation needs to expire. Once it expires it is put back into the JOB_ACTIVATABLE ColumnFamily\nThis ColumnFamily has a composite key. The first part is the timestamp at which the Job activation expires. The second part is the Job key\n\n\n\nWhat should we change?\nWe should introduce a new command to gRPC. The Job Worker can periodically emit this command as long as it's still working on a Job to override the deadline. This command would look something like this:\nmessage UpdateJobTimeoutRequest {\n  // the unique job identifier, as obtained from ActivateJobsResponse\n  int64 jobKey = 1;\n  // the duration of the new timeout, starting from the current moment\n  string timeout = 2;\n}\n\nmessage UpdateJobTimeoutResponse {\n}\nNotable is that it takes a duration. This is not the duration with which we will extend the timeout. Instead this will be the new duration the timeout is set to from the current time. This allows users to not only extend the timeout of a Job, but also gives users the option to shorten the timeout.\nNo tenant information needs to be provided in this command, as we have the Job key available. With this we can already check if the user is authorised to access this Job.\nA new command also means we need to add new intents to the JobIntent. These will be:\n\nUPDATE_TIMEOUT\n\nThis command will look for the Job in the state. If it can't find it it will return a NOT_FOUND rejection. Otherwise it will write the TIMEOUT_UPDATED event which will modify the deadline in the state.\nThis command will also look for a deadline in the state. If it can't find it it will return an INVALID_STATE rejection\n\n\nTIMEOUT_UPDATED\n\nThis event will update the JOB_DEADLINES ColumnFamily. Since the key of this ColumnFamily is deadline-jockey we can't just update the existing one. Instead we will need to remove the existing entry for this Job, and insert a new value. For this we must have access to the old deadline. This is stored in state and should available through the JobRecord.\n\n\n\nTask Breakdown\n\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

This way we can't use the ActorClock of the Broker.\nIf we calculate it broker-side we have to fit the duration in the JobRecord. We can either add a new property for this, or (a)buse the deadlineProperty. Putting the duration in the deadlineProperty makes it so the data in this property isn't exactly what the name suggests, but it is the easier approach. It only impacts the processor for this command, after which it's immediately set to the proper deadline again.\n\n\nWe've decided to add a timeoutProperty on the JobRecord and clarify with javadoc what it is used for. This makes a clear distinction in the record to hopefully reduce confusion. It also aligns better with job activation, where we users also define a timeout, which is the duration when a job times out after activating.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1734\nC7 API: https://docs.camunda.org/rest/camunda-bpm-platform/7.19-SNAPSHOT/#tag/External-Task/operation/extendLock",

When activating jobs users also specify a timeout, which in turn sets a deadline. Users always work using the term timeout. The only time they see deadline is in the activate job response, which is likely hidden behind a job worker. I'm not convinced naming it UpdateJobDeadline is better tbh."

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nFeature name\n⚠️ We don't like to name this feature extend job lock. First of all, it's not only used for extending. With this feature we will also support reducing the timeout of a Job, which we see as a valid use case. This is also something that's supported in C7. So instead of extend, we chose to call it updating.\nSecond, we don't have a locking mechanism in C8 as we do in C7. Therefore we don't want lock to be part of the name. We have never referred to Jobs as being locked in C8 and introducing this term now could cause confusion for users. Instead, we decided to go with timeout. This a term that users are already familiar with when working with job activations. So instead of job lock, we chose to call it job timeout.\nTl;dr we chose to name the topic Update Job Timeout as opposed to Job Extend Lock.\nSummary\n\nThere are jobs which have an elastic timespan, meaning they can run for 5 minutes, but can be also 24+ hours. For example in some projects there can be a lot of long-running background processes (duration is from several seconds to multiple hours and sometimes days).\nThe problem is that the workers picking up the jobs do not know in advance how long the given process take thus they can't accurately estimate a timeout.\nIn order to determine if a job is still OK, even though it takes a while, the job needs to extend the lock or update the timeout threshold. Using extremely long timeouts is no good idea, because then it can not be determined if a job failed a job.\nConcept\n\nWhat does it look like in the state?\nWhen a Job Worker activates a Job it can specify a timeout for how long the Job should remain activated (default: 5 minutes). In Zeebe we call this the deadline of the Job.\nIn the state 2 important changes are made when this happens:\n\nThe Job is removed from the JOB_ACTIVATABLE ColumnFamily\n\nThis makes it so no other Job Workers can activate the Job\n\n\nThe Job is added to the JOB_DEADLINES ColumnFamily\n\nThis ColumnFamily keeps track of the timestamp on which a Job activation needs to expire. Once it expires it is put back into the JOB_ACTIVATABLE ColumnFamily\nThis ColumnFamily has a composite key. The first part is the timestamp at which the Job activation expires. The second part is the Job key\n\n\n\nWhat should we change?\nWe should introduce a new command to gRPC. The Job Worker can periodically emit this command as long as it's still working on a Job to override the deadline. This command would look something like this:\nmessage UpdateJobTimeoutRequest {\n  // the unique job identifier, as obtained from ActivateJobsResponse\n  int64 jobKey = 1;\n  // the duration of the new timeout, starting from the current moment\n  string timeout = 2;\n}\n\nmessage UpdateJobTimeoutResponse {\n}\nNotable is that it takes a duration. This is not the duration with which we will extend the timeout. Instead this will be the new duration the timeout is set to from the current time. This allows users to not only extend the timeout of a Job, but also gives users the option to shorten the timeout.\nNo tenant information needs to be provided in this command, as we have the Job key available. With this we can already check if the user is authorised to access this Job.\nA new command also means we need to add new intents to the JobIntent. These will be:\n\nUPDATE_TIMEOUT\n\nThis command will look for the Job in the state. If it can't find it it will return a NOT_FOUND rejection. Otherwise it will write the TIMEOUT_UPDATED event which will modify the deadline in the state.\nThis command will also look for a deadline in the state. If it can't find it it will return an INVALID_STATE rejection\n\n\nTIMEOUT_UPDATED\n\nThis event will update the JOB_DEADLINES ColumnFamily. Since the key of this ColumnFamily is deadline-jockey we can't just update the existing one. Instead we will need to remove the existing entry for this Job, and insert a new value. For this we must have access to the old deadline. This is stored in state and should available through the JobRecord.\n\n\n\nTask Breakdown\n\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

This way we can't use the ActorClock of the Broker.\nIf we calculate it broker-side we have to fit the duration in the JobRecord. We can either add a new property for this, or (a)buse the deadlineProperty. Putting the duration in the deadlineProperty makes it so the data in this property isn't exactly what the name suggests, but it is the easier approach. It only impacts the processor for this command, after which it's immediately set to the proper deadline again.\n\n\nWe've decided to add a timeoutProperty on the JobRecord and clarify with javadoc what it is used for. This makes a clear distinction in the record to hopefully reduce confusion. It also aligns better with job activation, where we users also define a timeout, which is the duration when a job times out after activating.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1734\nC7 API: https://docs.camunda.org/rest/camunda-bpm-platform/7.19-SNAPSHOT/#tag/External-Task/operation/extendLock",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nWe execute tasks in our processes that sometimes have to be canceled later under certain circumstances. BPMN compensation events and compensation handlers are a very powerful construct for handling such situations.\nWithout these BPMN symbols, users would have to add a lot of additional complexity to their models.\n\nConcept\n\nBPMN compensation events are part of the BPMN 2.0 standard (chapter 13.4.5 Compensation, page 441).\nIn this iteration, we plan to implement the following features of compensation events:\n\nAdd support for compensation events:\n\nCompensation boundary events\nCompensation intermediate throw events\nCompensation end events\nCompensation start events (i.e. compensation event subprocesses)\n\n\nMark activities for compensation (i.e. compensation handlers):\n\nService Tasks\nUser Tasks\nSend Tasks\nScript Tasks\nManual Tasks\nUndefined Tasks\n\n\nTrigger compensation recursively for subprocesses\nAccess local variables (i.e. snapshot data) from completed subprocesses\nTrigger compensation for a given activity (i.e. instead of implicitly for the current scope)\n\nCompensation subscriptions\nIn order to compensate an activity, we need to keep track of completed activities with a compensation handler. Currently, we remove all data of an element instance from the state when it is completed. So, we need to store the data separately.\nThe only place to modify the state is within an event applier. An event applier is invoked on writing or replaying an event.\nWe could extend the existing event applier for the process_instance.COMPLETED event and store the data of the completed activity. But this would introduce additional non-trivial logic to the event applier and would violate our goal to keep the event appliers simple (i.e. only apply/write the state changes of the event).\nA better way is to move the logic in the processors and introduce a new record to manage the subscriptions for compensation.\nCompensation subscription\n========================\n\nRecord:\n- tenant id\n- process instance key\n- process definition key\n- element id of activity with compensation handler\n- flow scope element id of activity with compensation handler\n- element id of compensation throw event\n- element instance key of compensation throw event\n- local variables of activity with compensation handler (i.e. snapshot data)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nLifecyle:\nCREATED -> TRIGGERED -> COMPLETED | DELETED\n\n- on CREATED: \n - when an activity with a compensation boundary event is completed, or\n - when an embedded subprocess with a compensation event subprocess is completed\n - then add the subscription to the state \n- on TRIGGERED: \n - when the compensation throw event is activated\n - then set the element instance key and element id of the compensation throw event\n - and update the subscription in the state\n- on COMPLETED: \n - when the compensation handler is completed\n - then remove the subscription from the state\n- on DELETED: \n - when the process instance is completed or terminated\n - then remove the subscription from the state \n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nState:\n< process instance key | subscription key > -> subscription record\n\n- the subscription key can be used for the reverse ordering\n\n\nTask Breakdown\n\nBroker\n\n\n #14939\n #14942\n #14943\n #14944\n #14965\n #14967\n #15063\n #14970\n #15066\n #15065\n #15064\n #15068\n #15141\n #15152\n #15332\n #15334\n #15349\n #15451\n #15458\n #15459\n #15464\n #15465\n #15333\n\nGateway API\n\nNo changes in the gRPC API.\nExporters and Metrics\n\n\n #15140\n camunda/zeebe-analytics#23\n\nTesting\n\n\n #15495\n #15496\n #15498\n\nZeebe Process Test\n\n\n camunda/zeebe-process-test#995\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n camunda/camunda-docs#2802\n\nOut of scope\n\nMark activities for compensation (i.e. compensation handlers):\n\nCall activites\nEmbedded subprocesses\n\n\nTrigger compensation recursively for child process instances\nSupport compensation event subprocess on process level\nDon’t wait until compensation is completed\nInvoke compensation handlers synchronously in reverse order\nOptionally invoke compensation handlers if the activities are activated but not completed yet\nSupport for BPMN cancel events\nSupport for BPMN transactional subprocess\n\nOther Teams\n\n\n Operate\n Tasklist\n Web Modeler\n Desktop Modeler\n Optimize\n\nDiscussions and Decisions\n\nInvoke compensation handlers in reverse order\nAccording to the BPMN specification, the compensation handlers are invoked in the reserve order of the execution.\n\n(BPMN 2.0, 13.4.5 Compensation, page 442)\nWe don't plan to follow this rule. Instead, we will activate the compensation handlers altogether.\nConsider the following example:\n\nAssuming that the tasks \"A\" and \"B\" are completed. When the compensation end event is reached, we will activate the compensation tasks \"Undo A\" and \"Undo B\". Jobs workers can process these jobs concurrently and in any order.\nAccording to the BPMN specification, we should activate the task \"Undo B\" first. When the task is completed, we should activate the task \"Undo A\".\nIn Camunda 7, the reverse order of the compensation is only guaranteed if the compensation handlers are invoked synchronously (i.e. via JavaDelegate). Asynchronous or external tasks are activated concurrently.\nSince Camunda 8 works mainly with external tasks, the behavior will be the same.\nIf the order of the compensation handlers is important, the user could trigger the compensation for the activities explicitly. See the following example.\n\nInterrupt compensation handlers\nCan a compensation hander be interrupted/canceled?\nConsider the following examples:\n\nThe compensation handler is in the same scope as an interrupting event subprocess.\n\n\n\nThe compensation handler is inside an embedded subprocess that has an interrupting boundary event.\n\n\n\nThe compensation handler is in the same scope as a termination end event.\n\n\nIn Camunda 7, a compensation handler can be interrupted. In some of these cases, the process instance might end in an invalid state where the instance is stuck in the compensation throw event.\nThe BPMN specification is not clear about this scenario. It mentions only the following:\n\n[A compensation activity] is outside the normal flow of the Process.\n\nThis statement could indicate that compensation handlers are not affected by interrupting events.\n❓ How should we handle it in Camunda 8?\nInvoke compensation handler for an activity with an incident\nWhen triggering compensation, we invoke the compensation handlers of all completed activities. But what about activities with an incident in a COMPLETING state?\nIn this case, the underlying job of the activity has been completed but the variable output mapping failed to apply. From a BPMN perspective, the activity itself is not completed. However, the action and possible side effects were executed.\nTo undo the action, it could make sense to invoke the compensation handler even if the activity is not completed.\nIn Camunda 7, we don't have this case because there is no COMPLETING state. If the output mapping (or execution listener) fail then the transaction is rolled back and the activity is still active.\n❓ How should we handle it in Camunda 8?\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#219\nPublic roadmap issue: camunda/issues#56\nCamunda 7 documentation: https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.19/reference/bpmn20/events/cancel-and-compensation-events/",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\n\nKeep your running instances up-to-date with the latest process improvements (public roadmap issue).\nProcess Instance Migration is a feature that is available in Camunda 7 that allows process instances to be 'migrated' to another process model. Typically, this is useful when the process definition needs to be changed due to bugs or new requirements. This epic aims to add basic process instance migration functionality for relatively simple process definitions.\nEfforts on this feature start from lessons learned from the following issues, where we identified several potential iterations. However, that concept was overthrown after spiking another approach where we don't cancel the process instance and create a new instance using the target process definition, but rather adjust the existing process instance in such a way that the keys (process instance key, job keys, etc) remain the same:\n\n#11099\n#14960\n\nThis means that Process Instance Migration will allow users to migrate an existing process instance to a new process definition, but this will come with certain restrictions. For example, the type of an activity cannot be changed when mapping it in the migration plan.\nUsers can use Cancel Process Instance in combination with Create and Start at a User-Defined Element to overcome the limitations of Process Instance Migration, at the cost of losing the original process instance and a re-creation of the associated keys.\nRequirements and limitations\nProcess instances can only be migrated under the following requirements and limitations. The reasoning for each statement can be found by expanding the details.\nProcess instance migration can only migrate active process instances, i.e. existing process instances that have not yet been completed, terminated, or banned\n\nTerminated and completed process instances are removed from Zeebe, so Zeebe has no knowledge about them anymore.\nBanned process instances still exist in Zeebe. However, they are isolated from active instances so that they don't cause further damage. Banned instances cannot be recovered, but allow investigation by Zeebe developers to troubleshoot severe bugs.\n\n \nAll active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes)\n\nWe require all active elements in a process instance to have an explicit mapping in the migration plan. This is also a requirement for active Sub Processes.\nWhen a Sub Process is added nesting a mapped active element, the engine assumes that the user wants to have a new element instance of that Sub Process. Likewise, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element is removed, the engine could assume that the user wants to remove the element instance of that Sub Process. However, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, the user likely wants to reuse the element instance of the Sub Process. For example, if variables exist at this Sub Process, they wouldn't expect to lose them.\nNow consider the case where a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, but its element ID is changed. Should the engine consider this a different Sub Process from the active one, or does the user mean that this is the same Sub Process? There is no way for the engine to decide this for the user.\nTo highlight this, let's add one additional Sub Process to the target process nesting the Sub Process with the adjusted ID. In the example, we map Task A to A, what should happen to the instance of Sub Process Sub 1 and any variables existing on it?\n\n\nIf we recreate the Sub Process\n\nThe variables are lost\nOr the engine has to add logic to copy the variables automatically and choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3\n\n\nIf we adjust the Sub Process as Migrated\n\nThe engine has to choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3 as migration target and create an instance of the other\n\n\n\nIn both scenarios, the engine has to make a choice that it can't really make.\nThe alternative is to require users to provide a mapping for all active elements, including active Sub Processes. The engine can still assume to create new element instances for Sub Processes added to the hierarchy in the target process. When an active Sub Process is removed from the hierarchy, the user can provide an explicit mapping to:\n\na target Sub Process -> to migrate and keep the element instance\nno element \"\" (empty string) -> to terminate the element instance\n\nThis has several advantages:\n\nThe expected outcome of the migration plan is clear because the mappings are explicit\nIf the ID of a Sub Process is changed in a target process and the user forgets to map the Sub Process, it will otherwise lead to the loss of local variables existing at the Sub Process, or the engine has to make a choice for the user about copying the variables. This mistake could be easily made, so we should protect the user.\n\n\n \nMapping instructions cannot change the element type\n\nIf we would allow changing the element type, then type-specific expressions and entities may have to be created and/or removed depending on the mapping. This quickly leads to difficult situations.\nFor example, when mapping a service task to a user task, we'd have to remove the job, evaluate user-specific expressions (e.g. assignee), and create a new job with the new information, or adjust the existing job with the new info. If the type changes further from task to gateway, this also leads to more required changes. For Zeebe, it's best to keep this complexity under control and restrict how elements can be migrated.\nZeebe provides a way to move elements between elements of different types with the Process Instance Modification functionality. Users can modify and migrate a process instance in a two or three-step procedure:\n\nMigrate a process instance, keeping the active element unchanged and introducing a new element with a different type\nModify the process instance, moving the active element to the newly introduced element\nMigrate the process instance, removing the no longer needed element from the process\n\n\n \nThe target process definition must exist in Zeebe (deployed and not deleted)\n\nThis requirement should not raise any eyebrows. Zeebe must know what the target process looks like in order to migrate a process instance to it.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `sourceElementId` must refer to an element existing in the source process\n\nIf the mapping refers to a non-existing element id, then the user might have made a mistake in their mapping instructions. Instead of just accepting this, we prefer to point out the mistake. As process instance migration is a power tool, it's possible to damage a process instance. Therefore, we feel it's best to support the user wherever possible.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `targetElementId` must refer to an element existing in the target process (or refer to no element, i.e. `\"\"` empty string)\n\nExactly similar to the point above about sourceElementId, with one exception: if the mapping refers to a Sub Process, it's possible to remove the element instance by referring to no target element. See the discussion about All active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes) above.\n\n \nAdditional limitations\nThis epic will be limited as it only provides basic functionality and focuses on simpler process definitions. However, these are not requirements and may be changed later.\nThe number of active leaf element instances (i.e. tasks, events, gateways) stays the same\n\nWe may add support in future versions for removing or adding leaf element instances through specific mapping instructions, but we believe that this makes the feature unnecessarily complex. Users can use Process Instance Modification to remove or add element instances to a process instance and can combine it with Process Instance Migration in a multi-step procedure to deal with this. See the discussion on Mapping instructions cannot change the element type for an example of such a procedure changing step 2 to remove or add an element instance.\n\n\nConcept\nA new MigrateProcessInstance RPC will be added to Zeebe's Gateway to allow clients to migrate process instances. This RPC requires specifying a migration plan. This migration plan consists of mapping instructions specifying how active elements in the source process are migrated to elements in the target process.\nA simple migration example is migrating an active Service Task A to a process with that same Service Task A and a Service Task B after it. The mapping instructions specify that A is mapped to A. After the migration, the process instance is still waiting at Service Task A, and when completing its Job the process flows to Service Task B.\n\nReference-level details\n\nWe'll introduce a new MigrateProcessInstance RPC. This API allows for defining a migration plan consisting of a target process definition and a set of mapping instructions. Each instruction looks like [source element id -> target element id]. The RPC takes a MigrateProcessInstanceRequest similar to the following structure (note that the naming and structure are not yet definitive):\nmessage MigrateProcessInstanceRequest {\n  // key of process instance to migrate\n  int64 processInstanceKey = 1;\n\n  MigrationPlan migrationPlan = 2;\n\n  message MigrationPlan {\n    // the process definition key to migrate to\n    int64 targetProcessDefinitionKey = 1;\n    // source (to migrate from) element id and target element id (to migrate to)\n    repeated MappingInstruction mappingInstructions = 2;\n  }\n\n  message MappingInstruction {\n    // the element id to migrate from\n    string sourceElementId = 1;\n    // the element id to migrate to\n    string targetElementId = 2;\n  }\n}\nWhen migrating an instance, we adjust the active element instances in Zeebe's state using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. These make sure that the following information is updated:\n\nprocessDefinitionKey: the key of the target process definition\nbpmnProcessId: the BPMN ID of the target process definition\nversion: the version of the target process definition\nelementId: changes to the mapped element ID (note that the mapping may define the sourceElementId and the targetElementId as equivalent, in which case it stays the same)\nflowScopeKey: may change if the element exists within a different (sub)-process in the target process definition, e.g. when a new sub-process wraps the element or when a wrapping sub-process is removed in the diff between the source and target process definitions)\n\nSimilarly, we will adjust other entities:\n\njobs with Job:MIGRATED\nvariables with Variable:MIGRATED\nincidents with Incident:MIGRATED\n(eventually) event subscriptions like Timer:MIGRATED and SignalSubscription:MIGRATED, but these are kept out-of-scope initially by recreating event subscriptions\n\nIn the following example, both the element instance of the Process and the element instance of the active Service Task A are adjusted using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. The Job associated with Service Task A is also adjusted using a Job:MIGRATED event. If any Process Variables exist on the process instance, then these are adjusted using Variable:MIGRATED events.\n\nWe also need to adjust the internal entities (these exist in the state only and don't have their own associated records):\n\nEvent Scope Instance, requires changes to interrupting and boundary element ids\nEventTrigger, requires changes to elementId (but likely does not require adjustment for migrated instances)\n\nSuch internal entities can either:\n\nbe adjusted through the ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events\nbe promoted to have their own records so they can be adjusted through *:MIGRATED events\n\nNote that any entities introduced for new features will also need MIGRATED events to be adjusted. For example:\n\n#14938\n#14920\n#11217\n\nChanging the element hierarchy\nMigrated activities do not have to remain descendants of their closest migrating ancestor scope (Hierarchy Preservation) like in Camunda 7. Instead, a Sub Process can be added in the target process, nesting an element active in the source process. Zeebe will assume that the user intends to create a new element instance of the Sub Process that can be used as the ancestor scope of the active element.\nIn the following example, we see that element instance B is mapped to an element B that is nested inside A New Sub Process. A new element instance (with a new key) will be created for the element A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATING and ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATED. The flow scope (i.e. ancestor scope) of the element instance B is then adjusted to the key of the newly created instance of A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be added simultaneously.\n\nLikewise, a Sub Process in the source process may be removed in the target process. Zeebe will assume that the ancestor scope of the removed Sub Process instance can be used as the ancestor scope of any element active in that Sub Process.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be removed simultaneously.\n\nTask Breakdown #\n\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

variables of sub-processes when the scope hierarchy changes?\nIn Camunda7, there is a requirement for hierarchy preservation. It may be, that we don't have this same requirement in Zeebe. However, this lack presents ambiguity when it comes to copying variables of sub-processes.\nA potential solution would be introducing Variable Mapping Instructions to the Migration Plan, where the user can specify exactly where to move variables when removing a Sub Process from the hierarchy.\nThis functionality can be kept out of scope for now.\nHow should we deal with process instances in non-wait states?\nWhen the engine completes an element and flows to the next element, it:\n\nmarks the element as completed\nmarks the outgoing sequence flow as taken\nand appends a command to activate the next element for the process instance\n\nThis means that there are moments in time when an element is not active in the state. Rather the sequence flow is taken, and a not-yet-processed command describes the continuation of the process execution.\nAfter migrating the instance, such unprocessed commands will still be attempted to be processed, but they will be rejected because they refer to the now terminated source process instance.\nThis scenario also exists for Process Instance Modification, as the referenced process instance key stays the same for both modification and migration. However, parts of the process instance could be terminated, for which unprocessed commands could also be rejected.\nFor Process Instance Migration, other information (e.g. process definition key) has changed since the command was appended. What we could do to resolve this, is to never trust this data in ProcessInstance commands and always look up the current process definition by doing a lookup of the element instance by key. By trusting the state over the data in commands, we may be able to process more commands correctly.\nStill, an element activation command may be unprocessed targeting a no longer existing element id. In that case, the command will simply be rejected. The user may need to use Process Instance Modification to rectify the process instance state.\nThis scenario might not be too problematic, as it only affects non-wait states. Migration is typically done from wait state to wait state (e.g. user task to user task, service task to service task, etc), where the process has already reached that specific point and is awaiting further instructions from the client. For the cases where this affects non-wait states, modification can be used by the user to rectify any tokens lost during migration. In the future, process instance suspension may be used to stop process execution and increase the user's control over the process migration.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1470\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1829",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\n\nKeep your running instances up-to-date with the latest process improvements (public roadmap issue).\nProcess Instance Migration is a feature that is available in Camunda 7 that allows process instances to be 'migrated' to another process model. Typically, this is useful when the process definition needs to be changed due to bugs or new requirements. This epic aims to add basic process instance migration functionality for relatively simple process definitions.\nEfforts on this feature start from lessons learned from the following issues, where we identified several potential iterations. However, that concept was overthrown after spiking another approach where we don't cancel the process instance and create a new instance using the target process definition, but rather adjust the existing process instance in such a way that the keys (process instance key, job keys, etc) remain the same:\n\n#11099\n#14960\n\nThis means that Process Instance Migration will allow users to migrate an existing process instance to a new process definition, but this will come with certain restrictions. For example, the type of an activity cannot be changed when mapping it in the migration plan.\nUsers can use Cancel Process Instance in combination with Create and Start at a User-Defined Element to overcome the limitations of Process Instance Migration, at the cost of losing the original process instance and a re-creation of the associated keys.\nRequirements and limitations\nProcess instances can only be migrated under the following requirements and limitations. The reasoning for each statement can be found by expanding the details.\nProcess instance migration can only migrate active process instances, i.e. existing process instances that have not yet been completed, terminated, or banned\n\nTerminated and completed process instances are removed from Zeebe, so Zeebe has no knowledge about them anymore.\nBanned process instances still exist in Zeebe. However, they are isolated from active instances so that they don't cause further damage. Banned instances cannot be recovered, but allow investigation by Zeebe developers to troubleshoot severe bugs.\n\n \nAll active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes)\n\nWe require all active elements in a process instance to have an explicit mapping in the migration plan. This is also a requirement for active Sub Processes.\nWhen a Sub Process is added nesting a mapped active element, the engine assumes that the user wants to have a new element instance of that Sub Process. Likewise, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element is removed, the engine could assume that the user wants to remove the element instance of that Sub Process. However, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, the user likely wants to reuse the element instance of the Sub Process. For example, if variables exist at this Sub Process, they wouldn't expect to lose them.\nNow consider the case where a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, but its element ID is changed. Should the engine consider this a different Sub Process from the active one, or does the user mean that this is the same Sub Process? There is no way for the engine to decide this for the user.\nTo highlight this, let's add one additional Sub Process to the target process nesting the Sub Process with the adjusted ID. In the example, we map Task A to A, what should happen to the instance of Sub Process Sub 1 and any variables existing on it?\n\n\nIf we recreate the Sub Process\n\nThe variables are lost\nOr the engine has to add logic to copy the variables automatically and choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3\n\n\nIf we adjust the Sub Process as Migrated\n\nThe engine has to choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3 as migration target and create an instance of the other\n\n\n\nIn both scenarios, the engine has to make a choice that it can't really make.\nThe alternative is to require users to provide a mapping for all active elements, including active Sub Processes. The engine can still assume to create new element instances for Sub Processes added to the hierarchy in the target process. When an active Sub Process is removed from the hierarchy, the user can provide an explicit mapping to:\n\na target Sub Process -> to migrate and keep the element instance\nno element \"\" (empty string) -> to terminate the element instance\n\nThis has several advantages:\n\nThe expected outcome of the migration plan is clear because the mappings are explicit\nIf the ID of a Sub Process is changed in a target process and the user forgets to map the Sub Process, it will otherwise lead to the loss of local variables existing at the Sub Process, or the engine has to make a choice for the user about copying the variables. This mistake could be easily made, so we should protect the user.\n\n\n \nMapping instructions cannot change the element type\n\nIf we would allow changing the element type, then type-specific expressions and entities may have to be created and/or removed depending on the mapping. This quickly leads to difficult situations.\nFor example, when mapping a service task to a user task, we'd have to remove the job, evaluate user-specific expressions (e.g. assignee), and create a new job with the new information, or adjust the existing job with the new info. If the type changes further from task to gateway, this also leads to more required changes. For Zeebe, it's best to keep this complexity under control and restrict how elements can be migrated.\nZeebe provides a way to move elements between elements of different types with the Process Instance Modification functionality. Users can modify and migrate a process instance in a two or three-step procedure:\n\nMigrate a process instance, keeping the active element unchanged and introducing a new element with a different type\nModify the process instance, moving the active element to the newly introduced element\nMigrate the process instance, removing the no longer needed element from the process\n\n\n \nThe target process definition must exist in Zeebe (deployed and not deleted)\n\nThis requirement should not raise any eyebrows. Zeebe must know what the target process looks like in order to migrate a process instance to it.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `sourceElementId` must refer to an element existing in the source process\n\nIf the mapping refers to a non-existing element id, then the user might have made a mistake in their mapping instructions. Instead of just accepting this, we prefer to point out the mistake. As process instance migration is a power tool, it's possible to damage a process instance. Therefore, we feel it's best to support the user wherever possible.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `targetElementId` must refer to an element existing in the target process (or refer to no element, i.e. `\"\"` empty string)\n\nExactly similar to the point above about sourceElementId, with one exception: if the mapping refers to a Sub Process, it's possible to remove the element instance by referring to no target element. See the discussion about All active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes) above.\n\n \nAdditional limitations\nThis epic will be limited as it only provides basic functionality and focuses on simpler process definitions. However, these are not requirements and may be changed later.\nThe number of active leaf element instances (i.e. tasks, events, gateways) stays the same\n\nWe may add support in future versions for removing or adding leaf element instances through specific mapping instructions, but we believe that this makes the feature unnecessarily complex. Users can use Process Instance Modification to remove or add element instances to a process instance and can combine it with Process Instance Migration in a multi-step procedure to deal with this. See the discussion on Mapping instructions cannot change the element type for an example of such a procedure changing step 2 to remove or add an element instance.\n\n\nConcept\nA new MigrateProcessInstance RPC will be added to Zeebe's Gateway to allow clients to migrate process instances. This RPC requires specifying a migration plan. This migration plan consists of mapping instructions specifying how active elements in the source process are migrated to elements in the target process.\nA simple migration example is migrating an active Service Task A to a process with that same Service Task A and a Service Task B after it. The mapping instructions specify that A is mapped to A. After the migration, the process instance is still waiting at Service Task A, and when completing its Job the process flows to Service Task B.\n\nReference-level details\n\nWe'll introduce a new MigrateProcessInstance RPC. This API allows for defining a migration plan consisting of a target process definition and a set of mapping instructions. Each instruction looks like [source element id -> target element id]. The RPC takes a MigrateProcessInstanceRequest similar to the following structure (note that the naming and structure are not yet definitive):\nmessage MigrateProcessInstanceRequest {\n  // key of process instance to migrate\n  int64 processInstanceKey = 1;\n\n  MigrationPlan migrationPlan = 2;\n\n  message MigrationPlan {\n    // the process definition key to migrate to\n    int64 targetProcessDefinitionKey = 1;\n    // source (to migrate from) element id and target element id (to migrate to)\n    repeated MappingInstruction mappingInstructions = 2;\n  }\n\n  message MappingInstruction {\n    // the element id to migrate from\n    string sourceElementId = 1;\n    // the element id to migrate to\n    string targetElementId = 2;\n  }\n}\nWhen migrating an instance, we adjust the active element instances in Zeebe's state using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. These make sure that the following information is updated:\n\nprocessDefinitionKey: the key of the target process definition\nbpmnProcessId: the BPMN ID of the target process definition\nversion: the version of the target process definition\nelementId: changes to the mapped element ID (note that the mapping may define the sourceElementId and the targetElementId as equivalent, in which case it stays the same)\nflowScopeKey: may change if the element exists within a different (sub)-process in the target process definition, e.g. when a new sub-process wraps the element or when a wrapping sub-process is removed in the diff between the source and target process definitions)\n\nSimilarly, we will adjust other entities:\n\njobs with Job:MIGRATED\nvariables with Variable:MIGRATED\nincidents with Incident:MIGRATED\n(eventually) event subscriptions like Timer:MIGRATED and SignalSubscription:MIGRATED, but these are kept out-of-scope initially by recreating event subscriptions\n\nIn the following example, both the element instance of the Process and the element instance of the active Service Task A are adjusted using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. The Job associated with Service Task A is also adjusted using a Job:MIGRATED event. If any Process Variables exist on the process instance, then these are adjusted using Variable:MIGRATED events.\n\nWe also need to adjust the internal entities (these exist in the state only and don't have their own associated records):\n\nEvent Scope Instance, requires changes to interrupting and boundary element ids\nEventTrigger, requires changes to elementId (but likely does not require adjustment for migrated instances)\n\nSuch internal entities can either:\n\nbe adjusted through the ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events\nbe promoted to have their own records so they can be adjusted through *:MIGRATED events\n\nNote that any entities introduced for new features will also need MIGRATED events to be adjusted. For example:\n\n#14938\n#14920\n#11217\n\nChanging the element hierarchy\nMigrated activities do not have to remain descendants of their closest migrating ancestor scope (Hierarchy Preservation) like in Camunda 7. Instead, a Sub Process can be added in the target process, nesting an element active in the source process. Zeebe will assume that the user intends to create a new element instance of the Sub Process that can be used as the ancestor scope of the active element.\nIn the following example, we see that element instance B is mapped to an element B that is nested inside A New Sub Process. A new element instance (with a new key) will be created for the element A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATING and ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATED. The flow scope (i.e. ancestor scope) of the element instance B is then adjusted to the key of the newly created instance of A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be added simultaneously.\n\nLikewise, a Sub Process in the source process may be removed in the target process. Zeebe will assume that the ancestor scope of the removed Sub Process instance can be used as the ancestor scope of any element active in that Sub Process.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be removed simultaneously.\n\nTask Breakdown #\n\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

variables of sub-processes when the scope hierarchy changes?\nIn Camunda7, there is a requirement for hierarchy preservation. It may be, that we don't have this same requirement in Zeebe. However, this lack presents ambiguity when it comes to copying variables of sub-processes.\nA potential solution would be introducing Variable Mapping Instructions to the Migration Plan, where the user can specify exactly where to move variables when removing a Sub Process from the hierarchy.\nThis functionality can be kept out of scope for now.\nHow should we deal with process instances in non-wait states?\nWhen the engine completes an element and flows to the next element, it:\n\nmarks the element as completed\nmarks the outgoing sequence flow as taken\nand appends a command to activate the next element for the process instance\n\nThis means that there are moments in time when an element is not active in the state. Rather the sequence flow is taken, and a not-yet-processed command describes the continuation of the process execution.\nAfter migrating the instance, such unprocessed commands will still be attempted to be processed, but they will be rejected because they refer to the now terminated source process instance.\nThis scenario also exists for Process Instance Modification, as the referenced process instance key stays the same for both modification and migration. However, parts of the process instance could be terminated, for which unprocessed commands could also be rejected.\nFor Process Instance Migration, other information (e.g. process definition key) has changed since the command was appended. What we could do to resolve this, is to never trust this data in ProcessInstance commands and always look up the current process definition by doing a lookup of the element instance by key. By trusting the state over the data in commands, we may be able to process more commands correctly.\nStill, an element activation command may be unprocessed targeting a no longer existing element id. In that case, the command will simply be rejected. The user may need to use Process Instance Modification to rectify the process instance state.\nThis scenario might not be too problematic, as it only affects non-wait states. Migration is typically done from wait state to wait state (e.g. user task to user task, service task to service task, etc), where the process has already reached that specific point and is awaiting further instructions from the client. For the cases where this affects non-wait states, modification can be used by the user to rectify any tokens lost during migration. In the future, process instance suspension may be used to stop process execution and increase the user's control over the process migration.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1470\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1829",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nWe execute tasks in our processes that sometimes have to be canceled later under certain circumstances. BPMN compensation events and compensation handlers are a very powerful construct for handling such situations.\nWithout these BPMN symbols, users would have to add a lot of additional complexity to their models.\n\nConcept\n\nBPMN compensation events are part of the BPMN 2.0 standard (chapter 13.4.5 Compensation, page 441).\nIn this iteration, we plan to implement the following features of compensation events:\n\nAdd support for compensation events:\n\nCompensation boundary events\nCompensation intermediate throw events\nCompensation end events\nCompensation start events (i.e. compensation event subprocesses)\n\n\nMark activities for compensation (i.e. compensation handlers):\n\nService Tasks\nUser Tasks\nSend Tasks\nScript Tasks\nManual Tasks\nUndefined Tasks\n\n\nTrigger compensation recursively for subprocesses\nAccess local variables (i.e. snapshot data) from completed subprocesses\nTrigger compensation for a given activity (i.e. instead of implicitly for the current scope)\n\nCompensation subscriptions\nIn order to compensate an activity, we need to keep track of completed activities with a compensation handler. Currently, we remove all data of an element instance from the state when it is completed. So, we need to store the data separately.\nThe only place to modify the state is within an event applier. An event applier is invoked on writing or replaying an event.\nWe could extend the existing event applier for the process_instance.COMPLETED event and store the data of the completed activity. But this would introduce additional non-trivial logic to the event applier and would violate our goal to keep the event appliers simple (i.e. only apply/write the state changes of the event).\nA better way is to move the logic in the processors and introduce a new record to manage the subscriptions for compensation.\nCompensation subscription\n========================\n\nRecord:\n- tenant id\n- process instance key\n- process definition key\n- element id of activity with compensation handler\n- flow scope element id of activity with compensation handler\n- element id of compensation throw event\n- element instance key of compensation throw event\n- local variables of activity with compensation handler (i.e. snapshot data)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nLifecyle:\nCREATED -> TRIGGERED -> COMPLETED | DELETED\n\n- on CREATED: \n - when an activity with a compensation boundary event is completed, or\n - when an embedded subprocess with a compensation event subprocess is completed\n - then add the subscription to the state \n- on TRIGGERED: \n - when the compensation throw event is activated\n - then set the element instance key and element id of the compensation throw event\n - and update the subscription in the state\n- on COMPLETED: \n - when the compensation handler is completed\n - then remove the subscription from the state\n- on DELETED: \n - when the process instance is completed or terminated\n - then remove the subscription from the state \n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nState:\n< process instance key | subscription key > -> subscription record\n\n- the subscription key can be used for the reverse ordering\n\n\nTask Breakdown\n\nBroker\n\n\n #14939\n #14942\n #14943\n #14944\n #14965\n #14967\n #15063\n #14970\n #15066\n #15065\n #15064\n #15068\n #15141\n #15152\n #15332\n #15334\n #15349\n #15451\n #15458\n #15459\n #15464\n #15465\n #15333\n\nGateway API\n\nNo changes in the gRPC API.\nExporters and Metrics\n\n\n #15140\n camunda/zeebe-analytics#23\n\nTesting\n\n\n #15495\n #15496\n #15498\n\nZeebe Process Test\n\n\n camunda/zeebe-process-test#995\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n camunda/camunda-docs#2802\n\nOut of scope\n\nMark activities for compensation (i.e. compensation handlers):\n\nCall activites\nEmbedded subprocesses\n\n\nTrigger compensation recursively for child process instances\nSupport compensation event subprocess on process level\nDon’t wait until compensation is completed\nInvoke compensation handlers synchronously in reverse order\nOptionally invoke compensation handlers if the activities are activated but not completed yet\nSupport for BPMN cancel events\nSupport for BPMN transactional subprocess\n\nOther Teams\n\n\n Operate\n Tasklist\n Web Modeler\n Desktop Modeler\n Optimize\n\nDiscussions and Decisions\n\nInvoke compensation handlers in reverse order\nAccording to the BPMN specification, the compensation handlers are invoked in the reserve order of the execution.\n\n(BPMN 2.0, 13.4.5 Compensation, page 442)\nWe don't plan to follow this rule. Instead, we will activate the compensation handlers altogether.\nConsider the following example:\n\nAssuming that the tasks \"A\" and \"B\" are completed. When the compensation end event is reached, we will activate the compensation tasks \"Undo A\" and \"Undo B\". Jobs workers can process these jobs concurrently and in any order.\nAccording to the BPMN specification, we should activate the task \"Undo B\" first. When the task is completed, we should activate the task \"Undo A\".\nIn Camunda 7, the reverse order of the compensation is only guaranteed if the compensation handlers are invoked synchronously (i.e. via JavaDelegate). Asynchronous or external tasks are activated concurrently.\nSince Camunda 8 works mainly with external tasks, the behavior will be the same.\nIf the order of the compensation handlers is important, the user could trigger the compensation for the activities explicitly. See the following example.\n\nInterrupt compensation handlers\nCan a compensation hander be interrupted/canceled?\nConsider the following examples:\n\nThe compensation handler is in the same scope as an interrupting event subprocess.\n\n\n\nThe compensation handler is inside an embedded subprocess that has an interrupting boundary event.\n\n\n\nThe compensation handler is in the same scope as a termination end event.\n\n\nIn Camunda 7, a compensation handler can be interrupted. In some of these cases, the process instance might end in an invalid state where the instance is stuck in the compensation throw event.\nThe BPMN specification is not clear about this scenario. It mentions only the following:\n\n[A compensation activity] is outside the normal flow of the Process.\n\nThis statement could indicate that compensation handlers are not affected by interrupting events.\n❓ How should we handle it in Camunda 8?\nInvoke compensation handler for an activity with an incident\nWhen triggering compensation, we invoke the compensation handlers of all completed activities. But what about activities with an incident in a COMPLETING state?\nIn this case, the underlying job of the activity has been completed but the variable output mapping failed to apply. From a BPMN perspective, the activity itself is not completed. However, the action and possible side effects were executed.\nTo undo the action, it could make sense to invoke the compensation handler even if the activity is not completed.\nIn Camunda 7, we don't have this case because there is no COMPLETING state. If the output mapping (or execution listener) fail then the transaction is rolled back and the activity is still active.\n❓ How should we handle it in Camunda 8?\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#219\nPublic roadmap issue: camunda/issues#56\nCamunda 7 documentation: https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.19/reference/bpmn20/events/cancel-and-compensation-events/",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nFeature name\n⚠️ We don't like to name this feature extend job lock. First of all, it's not only used for extending. With this feature we will also support reducing the timeout of a Job, which we see as a valid use case. This is also something that's supported in C7. So instead of extend, we chose to call it updating.\nSecond, we don't have a locking mechanism in C8 as we do in C7. Therefore we don't want lock to be part of the name. We have never referred to Jobs as being locked in C8 and introducing this term now could cause confusion for users. Instead, we decided to go with timeout. This a term that users are already familiar with when working with job activations. So instead of job lock, we chose to call it job timeout.\nTl;dr we chose to name the topic Update Job Timeout as opposed to Job Extend Lock.\nSummary\n\nThere are jobs which have an elastic timespan, meaning they can run for 5 minutes, but can be also 24+ hours. For example in some projects there can be a lot of long-running background processes (duration is from several seconds to multiple hours and sometimes days).\nThe problem is that the workers picking up the jobs do not know in advance how long the given process take thus they can't accurately estimate a timeout.\nIn order to determine if a job is still OK, even though it takes a while, the job needs to extend the lock or update the timeout threshold. Using extremely long timeouts is no good idea, because then it can not be determined if a job failed a job.\nConcept\n\nWhat does it look like in the state?\nWhen a Job Worker activates a Job it can specify a timeout for how long the Job should remain activated (default: 5 minutes). In Zeebe we call this the deadline of the Job.\nIn the state 2 important changes are made when this happens:\n\nThe Job is removed from the JOB_ACTIVATABLE ColumnFamily\n\nThis makes it so no other Job Workers can activate the Job\n\n\nThe Job is added to the JOB_DEADLINES ColumnFamily\n\nThis ColumnFamily keeps track of the timestamp on which a Job activation needs to expire. Once it expires it is put back into the JOB_ACTIVATABLE ColumnFamily\nThis ColumnFamily has a composite key. The first part is the timestamp at which the Job activation expires. The second part is the Job key\n\n\n\nWhat should we change?\nWe should introduce a new command to gRPC. The Job Worker can periodically emit this command as long as it's still working on a Job to override the deadline. This command would look something like this:\nmessage UpdateJobTimeoutRequest {\n  // the unique job identifier, as obtained from ActivateJobsResponse\n  int64 jobKey = 1;\n  // the duration of the new timeout, starting from the current moment\n  string timeout = 2;\n}\n\nmessage UpdateJobTimeoutResponse {\n}\nNotable is that it takes a duration. This is not the duration with which we will extend the timeout. Instead this will be the new duration the timeout is set to from the current time. This allows users to not only extend the timeout of a Job, but also gives users the option to shorten the timeout.\nNo tenant information needs to be provided in this command, as we have the Job key available. With this we can already check if the user is authorised to access this Job.\nA new command also means we need to add new intents to the JobIntent. These will be:\n\nUPDATE_TIMEOUT\n\nThis command will look for the Job in the state. If it can't find it it will return a NOT_FOUND rejection. Otherwise it will write the TIMEOUT_UPDATED event which will modify the deadline in the state.\nThis command will also look for a deadline in the state. If it can't find it it will return an INVALID_STATE rejection\n\n\nTIMEOUT_UPDATED\n\nThis event will update the JOB_DEADLINES ColumnFamily. Since the key of this ColumnFamily is deadline-jockey we can't just update the existing one. Instead we will need to remove the existing entry for this Job, and insert a new value.

This way we can't use the ActorClock of the Broker.\nIf we calculate it broker-side we have to fit the duration in the JobRecord. We can either add a new property for this, or (a)buse the deadlineProperty. Putting the duration in the deadlineProperty makes it so the data in this property isn't exactly what the name suggests, but it is the easier approach. It only impacts the processor for this command, after which it's immediately set to the proper deadline again.\n\n\nWe've decided to add a timeoutProperty on the JobRecord and clarify with javadoc what it is used for. This makes a clear distinction in the record to hopefully reduce confusion. It also aligns better with job activation, where we users also define a timeout, which is the duration when a job times out after activating.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1734\nC7 API: https://docs.camunda.org/rest/camunda-bpm-platform/7.19-SNAPSHOT/#tag/External-Task/operation/extendLock",

When activating jobs users also specify a timeout, which in turn sets a deadline. Users always work using the term timeout. The only time they see deadline is in the activate job response, which is likely hidden behind a job worker. I'm not convinced naming it UpdateJobDeadline is better tbh."

BPMN compensation events and compensation handlers are a very powerful construct for handling such situations.\nWithout these BPMN symbols, users would have to add a lot of additional complexity to their models.\n\nConcept\n\nBPMN compensation events are part of the BPMN 2.0 standard (chapter 13.4.5 Compensation, page 441).\nIn this iteration, we plan to implement the following features of compensation events:\n\nAdd support for compensation events:\n\nCompensation boundary events\nCompensation intermediate throw events\nCompensation end events\nCompensation start events (i.e. compensation event subprocesses)\n\n\nMark activities for compensation (i.e. compensation handlers):\n\nService Tasks\nUser Tasks\nSend Tasks\nScript Tasks\nManual Tasks\nUndefined Tasks\n\n\nTrigger compensation recursively for subprocesses\nAccess local variables (i.e. snapshot data) from completed subprocesses\nTrigger compensation for a given activity (i.e. instead of implicitly for the current scope)\n\nCompensation subscriptions\nIn order to compensate an activity, we need to keep track of completed activities with a compensation handler. Currently, we remove all data of an element instance from the state when it is completed. So, we need to store the data separately.\nThe only place to modify the state is within an event applier. An event applier is invoked on writing or replaying an event.\nWe could extend the existing event applier for the process_instance.COMPLETED event and store the data of the completed activity. But this would introduce additional non-trivial logic to the event applier and would violate our goal to keep the event appliers simple (i.e. only apply/write the state changes of the event).\nA better way is to move the logic in the processors and introduce a new record to manage the subscriptions for compensation.\nCompensation subscription\n========================\n\nRecord:\n- tenant id\n- process instance key\n- process definition key\n- element id of activity with compensation handler\n- flow scope element id of activity with compensation handler\n- element id of compensation throw event\n- element instance key of compensation throw event\n- local variables of activity with compensation handler (i.e. snapshot data)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nLifecyle:\nCREATED -> TRIGGERED -> COMPLETED | DELETED\n\n- on CREATED: \n - when an activity with a compensation boundary event is completed, or\n - when an embedded subprocess with a compensation event subprocess is completed\n - then add the subscription to the state \n- on TRIGGERED: \n - when the compensation throw event is activated\n - then set the element instance key and element id of the compensation throw event\n - and update the subscription in the state\n- on COMPLETED: \n - when the compensation handler is completed\n - then remove the subscription from the state\n- on DELETED: \n - when the process instance is completed or terminated\n - then remove the subscription from the state \n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nState:\n< process instance key | subscription key > -> subscription record\n\n- the subscription key can be used for the reverse ordering\n\n\nTask Breakdown\n\nBroker\n\n\n #14939\n #14942\n #14943\n #14944\n #14965\n #14967\n #15063\n #14970\n #15066\n #15065\n #15064\n #15068\n #15141\n #15152\n #15332\n #15334\n #15349\n #15451\n #15458\n #15459\n #15464\n #15465\n #15333\n\nGateway API\n\nNo changes in the gRPC API.\nExporters and Metrics\n\n\n #15140\n camunda/zeebe-analytics#23\n\nTesting\n\n\n #15495\n #15496\n #15498\n\nZeebe Process Test\n\n\n camunda/zeebe-process-test#995\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n camunda/camunda-docs#2802\n\nOut of scope\n\nMark activities for compensation (i.e. compensation handlers):\n\nCall activites\nEmbedded subprocesses\n\n\nTrigger compensation recursively for child process instances\nSupport compensation event subprocess on process level\nDon’t wait until compensation is completed\nInvoke compensation handlers synchronously in reverse order\nOptionally invoke compensation handlers if the activities are activated but not completed yet\nSupport for BPMN cancel events\nSupport for BPMN transactional subprocess\n\nOther Teams\n\n\n Operate\n Tasklist\n Web Modeler\n Desktop Modeler\n Optimize\n\nDiscussions and Decisions\n\nInvoke compensation handlers in reverse order\nAccording to the BPMN specification, the compensation handlers are invoked in the reserve order of the execution.\n\n(BPMN 2.0, 13.4.5 Compensation, page 442)\nWe don't plan to follow this rule. Instead, we will activate the compensation handlers altogether.\nConsider the following example:\n\nAssuming that the tasks \"A\" and \"B\" are completed. When the compensation end event is reached, we will activate the compensation tasks \"Undo A\" and \"Undo B\". Jobs workers can process these jobs concurrently and in any order.\nAccording to the BPMN specification, we should activate the task \"Undo B\" first. When the task is completed, we should activate the task \"Undo A\".\nIn Camunda 7, the reverse order of the compensation is only guaranteed if the compensation handlers are invoked synchronously (i.e. via JavaDelegate). Asynchronous or external tasks are activated concurrently.\nSince Camunda 8 works mainly with external tasks, the behavior will be the same.\nIf the order of the compensation handlers is important, the user could trigger the compensation for the activities explicitly. See the following example.\n\nInterrupt compensation handlers\nCan a compensation hander be interrupted/canceled?\nConsider the following examples:\n\nThe compensation handler is in the same scope as an interrupting event subprocess.\n\n\n\nThe compensation handler is inside an embedded subprocess that has an interrupting boundary event.\n\n\n\nThe compensation handler is in the same scope as a termination end event.\n\n\nIn Camunda 7, a compensation handler can be interrupted. In some of these cases, the process instance might end in an invalid state where the instance is stuck in the compensation throw event.\nThe BPMN specification is not clear about this scenario. It mentions only the following:\n\n[A compensation activity] is outside the normal flow of the Process.\n\nThis statement could indicate that compensation handlers are not affected by interrupting events.\n❓ How should we handle it in Camunda 8?\nInvoke compensation handler for an activity with an incident\nWhen triggering compensation, we invoke the compensation handlers of all completed activities. But what about activities with an incident in a COMPLETING state?\nIn this case, the underlying job of the activity has been completed but the variable output mapping failed to apply. From a BPMN perspective, the activity itself is not completed. However, the action and possible side effects were executed.\nTo undo the action, it could make sense to invoke the compensation handler even if the activity is not completed.\nIn Camunda 7, we don't have this case because there is no COMPLETING state. If the output mapping (or execution listener) fail then the transaction is rolled back and the activity is still active.\n❓ How should we handle it in Camunda 8?\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#219\nPublic roadmap issue: camunda/issues#56\nCamunda 7 documentation: https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.19/reference/bpmn20/events/cancel-and-compensation-events/",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nWe execute tasks in our processes that sometimes have to be canceled later under certain circumstances. BPMN compensation events and compensation handlers are a very powerful construct for handling such situations.\nWithout these BPMN symbols, users would have to add a lot of additional complexity to their models.\n\nConcept\n\nBPMN compensation events are part of the BPMN 2.0 standard (chapter 13.4.5 Compensation, page 441).\nIn this iteration, we plan to implement the following features of compensation events:\n\nAdd support for compensation events:\n\nCompensation boundary events\nCompensation intermediate throw events\nCompensation end events\nCompensation start events (i.e. compensation event subprocesses)\n\n\nMark activities for compensation (i.e. compensation handlers):\n\nService Tasks\nUser Tasks\nSend Tasks\nScript Tasks\nManual Tasks\nUndefined Tasks\n\n\nTrigger compensation recursively for subprocesses\nAccess local variables (i.e. snapshot data) from completed subprocesses\nTrigger compensation for a given activity (i.e. instead of implicitly for the current scope)\n\nCompensation subscriptions\nIn order to compensate an activity, we need to keep track of completed activities with a compensation handler. Currently, we remove all data of an element instance from the state when it is completed. So, we need to store the data separately.\nThe only place to modify the state is within an event applier. An event applier is invoked on writing or replaying an event.\nWe could extend the existing event applier for the process_instance.COMPLETED event and store the data of the completed activity. But this would introduce additional non-trivial logic to the event applier and would violate our goal to keep the event appliers simple (i.e. only apply/write the state changes of the event).\nA better way is to move the logic in the processors and introduce a new record to manage the subscriptions for compensation.\nCompensation subscription\n========================\n\nRecord:\n- tenant id\n- process instance key\n- process definition key\n- element id of activity with compensation handler\n- flow scope element id of activity with compensation handler\n- element id of compensation throw event\n- element instance key of compensation throw event\n- local variables of activity with compensation handler (i.e. snapshot data)\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nLifecyle:\nCREATED -> TRIGGERED -> COMPLETED | DELETED\n\n- on CREATED: \n - when an activity with a compensation boundary event is completed, or\n - when an embedded subprocess with a compensation event subprocess is completed\n - then add the subscription to the state \n- on TRIGGERED: \n - when the compensation throw event is activated\n - then set the element instance key and element id of the compensation throw event\n - and update the subscription in the state\n- on COMPLETED: \n - when the compensation handler is completed\n - then remove the subscription from the state\n- on DELETED: \n - when the process instance is completed or terminated\n - then remove the subscription from the state \n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nState:\n< process instance key | subscription key > -> subscription record\n\n- the subscription key can be used for the reverse ordering\n\n\nTask Breakdown\n\nBroker\n\n\n #14939\n #14942\n #14943\n #14944\n #14965\n #14967\n #15063\n #14970\n #15066\n #15065\n #15064\n #15068\n #15141\n #15152\n #15332\n #15334\n #15349\n #15451\n #15458\n #15459\n #15464\n #15465\n #15333\n\nGateway API\n\nNo changes in the gRPC API.\nExporters and Metrics\n\n\n #15140\n camunda/zeebe-analytics#23\n\nTesting\n\n\n #15495\n #15496\n #15498\n\nZeebe Process Test\n\n\n camunda/zeebe-process-test#995\n\nDocumentation\n\n\n camunda/camunda-docs#2802\n\nOut of scope\n\nMark activities for compensation (i.e. compensation handlers):\n\nCall activites\nEmbedded subprocesses\n\n\nTrigger compensation recursively for child process instances\nSupport compensation event subprocess on process level\nDon’t wait until compensation is completed\nInvoke compensation handlers synchronously in reverse order\nOptionally invoke compensation handlers if the activities are activated but not completed yet\nSupport for BPMN cancel events\nSupport for BPMN transactional subprocess\n\nOther Teams\n\n\n Operate\n Tasklist\n Web Modeler\n Desktop Modeler\n Optimize\n\nDiscussions and Decisions\n\nInvoke compensation handlers in reverse order\nAccording to the BPMN specification, the compensation handlers are invoked in the reserve order of the execution.\n\n(BPMN 2.0, 13.4.5 Compensation, page 442)\nWe don't plan to follow this rule. Instead, we will activate the compensation handlers altogether.\nConsider the following example:\n\nAssuming that the tasks \"A\" and \"B\" are completed. When the compensation end event is reached, we will activate the compensation tasks \"Undo A\" and \"Undo B\". Jobs workers can process these jobs concurrently and in any order.\nAccording to the BPMN specification, we should activate the task \"Undo B\" first. When the task is completed, we should activate the task \"Undo A\".\nIn Camunda 7, the reverse order of the compensation is only guaranteed if the compensation handlers are invoked synchronously (i.e. via JavaDelegate). Asynchronous or external tasks are activated concurrently.\nSince Camunda 8 works mainly with external tasks, the behavior will be the same.\nIf the order of the compensation handlers is important, the user could trigger the compensation for the activities explicitly. See the following example.\n\nInterrupt compensation handlers\nCan a compensation hander be interrupted/canceled?\nConsider the following examples:\n\nThe compensation handler is in the same scope as an interrupting event subprocess.\n\n\n\nThe compensation handler is inside an embedded subprocess that has an interrupting boundary event.\n\n\n\nThe compensation handler is in the same scope as a termination end event.\n\n\nIn Camunda 7, a compensation handler can be interrupted. In some of these cases, the process instance might end in an invalid state where the instance is stuck in the compensation throw event.\nThe BPMN specification is not clear about this scenario. It mentions only the following:\n\n[A compensation activity] is outside the normal flow of the Process.\n\nThis statement could indicate that compensation handlers are not affected by interrupting events.\n❓ How should we handle it in Camunda 8?\nInvoke compensation handler for an activity with an incident\nWhen triggering compensation, we invoke the compensation handlers of all completed activities. But what about activities with an incident in a COMPLETING state?\nIn this case, the underlying job of the activity has been completed but the variable output mapping failed to apply. From a BPMN perspective, the activity itself is not completed. However, the action and possible side effects were executed.\nTo undo the action, it could make sense to invoke the compensation handler even if the activity is not completed.\nIn Camunda 7, we don't have this case because there is no COMPLETING state. If the output mapping (or execution listener) fail then the transaction is rolled back and the activity is still active.\n❓ How should we handle it in Camunda 8?\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#219\nPublic roadmap issue: camunda/issues#56\nCamunda 7 documentation: https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.19/reference/bpmn20/events/cancel-and-compensation-events/",

    "bodyText": "Description\nFor multi-tenancy, the goal of the Zeebe Gateway is to:\n\nProvide data on the user's authorized tenants.\nForward this data (through the RecordMetadata) to the Zeebe Broker through a Broker*Request instance.\n\nFull support for multi-tenancy in the Zeebe gateway will be provided once camunda-cloud/identity#1819 is completed.\nFor this issue, the Zeebe Gateway should (only) support the following:\n\nProvide a Gateway configuration flag: zeebe.gateway.multiTenancy.enabled - default FALSE (disabled)\n\nThe flag should toggle multi-tenancy for the Zeebe cluster.\nAn enabled flag is preferred, as we will probably add additional multi-tenancy configuration properties in the future.\n\n\nExpand the IdentityInterceptor class. After the token is successfully verified the following should be performed:\n\nProvide a list of tenant ids the user has access to:\n\nIf multi-tenancy is disabled, the list should only contain the <default> tenant id (see #13235)\nIf multi-tenancy is enabled, the Identity SDK should be used to fetch the list of tenant ids (out-of-scope for this issue)\n\n\n[Proposal] Place the list of tenant IDs in a gRPC context to be forwarded to the EndpointManager/RequestMapper (consider doing it through a helper class).\n\n\nWe should provide a general (auth) API that the IdentityInterceptor class will implement. The goal is to provide an Identity-independent use of multi-tenancy, i.e. users can use a multi-tenant Zeebe without the need of Camunda Identity.\n\nAC:\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

Does the Gateway still provide the default tenant to include it in the respective broker requests?\n\nI would assume that the default tenant would be added to the tenant access ids list, so it can be used in the broker requests where the default tenant is assumed when multi-tenancy is disabled.

like process instances and jobs. The intention is to provide multi-tenancy support for these concepts early in the implementation so that other Camunda Platform 8 components are unblocked, and can start implementing multi-tenancy on their side as well.\nEach task of phase 2 covers the vertical implementation (engine, gateway, client, data migration, documentation) for a Zeebe concept. The vertical implementation of the deployments functionality can serve as an example.\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

like process instances and jobs. The intention is to provide multi-tenancy support for these concepts early in the implementation so that other Camunda Platform 8 components are unblocked, and can start implementing multi-tenancy on their side as well.\nEach task of phase 2 covers the vertical implementation (engine, gateway, client, data migration, documentation) for a Zeebe concept. The vertical implementation of the deployments functionality can serve as an example.\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

like process instances and jobs. The intention is to provide multi-tenancy support for these concepts early in the implementation so that other Camunda Platform 8 components are unblocked, and can start implementing multi-tenancy on their side as well.\nEach task of phase 2 covers the vertical implementation (engine, gateway, client, data migration, documentation) for a Zeebe concept. The vertical implementation of the deployments functionality can serve as an example.\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

This gives more resources per partition which will then be able to handle the workload. Scaling this way is limited because it depends on how many partitions were initially provisioned. However, this is the first step towards dynamic scaling Zeebe to handle increased workloads.\nTask Breakdown\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

Will create issues for these later.\n\n Retry operations in TopologyChangeApplier or ClusterTopologyManager. Operations like partition join/leave can fail due to temporary issues like timeout, unavailability of leader. This should be retried.\n Add revapi to check backward compatibility issues with protobuf definitions in topology module\n Allow configuring cluster topology gossipper. Currently the configs such as sync interval, timeout etc.. are hard coded.\n Single member cannot leave a partition\n Engine factory should read partition count from ClusterTopology. Eventhough we don't allow change partition count yet, ClusterTopology is the source of truth. It should be possible to start a broker with wrong configuration, but it find the correct one from the coordinator.\n Add checksum in persisted cluster topology to detect corruption\n Partition join request to non existing partition should be rejected\n\nAdditional improvements\n\nShould we specify which node is coordinator via Broker configs?\nShould we allow changing coordinator dynamically?"

You have to explicitly trigger scaling via the rest api.\n\nSome limitations/potential improvements:\n\nBroker 0 is the designated code to coordinate any topology changes. When Broker 0 is not available, no other broker can take over the responsibility. This means that any scaling operation can be done when Broker 0 is healthy. Potential improvement - allow overriding this via config. Further improvement, brokers can elect a coordinator themselves based on availability.\nCancelling a stuck scaling operation is tricky and dangerous."

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nGoal: I can add or remove brokers to an existing Zeebe clusters while keeping the partitions count same.\nWhen a user provisioned the cluster for a specific workload and later the workload is increased, the cluster can be scaled by adding more brokers and moving some of the partitions to the new brokers. This gives more resources per partition which will then be able to handle the workload. Scaling this way is limited because it depends on how many partitions were initially provisioned. However, this is the first step towards dynamic scaling Zeebe to handle increased workloads.\nTask Breakdown\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

Will create issues for these later.\n\n Retry operations in TopologyChangeApplier or ClusterTopologyManager. Operations like partition join/leave can fail due to temporary issues like timeout, unavailability of leader. This should be retried.\n Add revapi to check backward compatibility issues with protobuf definitions in topology module\n Allow configuring cluster topology gossipper. Currently the configs such as sync interval, timeout etc.. are hard coded.\n Single member cannot leave a partition\n Engine factory should read partition count from ClusterTopology. Eventhough we don't allow change partition count yet, ClusterTopology is the source of truth. It should be possible to start a broker with wrong configuration, but it find the correct one from the coordinator.\n Add checksum in persisted cluster topology to detect corruption\n Partition join request to non existing partition should be rejected\n\nAdditional improvements\n\nShould we specify which node is coordinator via Broker configs?\nShould we allow changing coordinator dynamically?"

You have to explicitly trigger scaling via the rest api.\n\nSome limitations/potential improvements:\n\nBroker 0 is the designated code to coordinate any topology changes. When Broker 0 is not available, no other broker can take over the responsibility. This means that any scaling operation can be done when Broker 0 is healthy. Potential improvement - allow overriding this via config. Further improvement, brokers can elect a coordinator themselves based on availability.\nCancelling a stuck scaling operation is tricky and dangerous."

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nGoal: I can add or remove brokers to an existing Zeebe clusters while keeping the partitions count same.\nWhen a user provisioned the cluster for a specific workload and later the workload is increased, the cluster can be scaled by adding more brokers and moving some of the partitions to the new brokers. This gives more resources per partition which will then be able to handle the workload. Scaling this way is limited because it depends on how many partitions were initially provisioned. However, this is the first step towards dynamic scaling Zeebe to handle increased workloads.\nTask Breakdown\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

Will create issues for these later.\n\n Retry operations in TopologyChangeApplier or ClusterTopologyManager. Operations like partition join/leave can fail due to temporary issues like timeout, unavailability of leader. This should be retried.\n Add revapi to check backward compatibility issues with protobuf definitions in topology module\n Allow configuring cluster topology gossipper. Currently the configs such as sync interval, timeout etc.. are hard coded.\n Single member cannot leave a partition\n Engine factory should read partition count from ClusterTopology. Eventhough we don't allow change partition count yet, ClusterTopology is the source of truth. It should be possible to start a broker with wrong configuration, but it find the correct one from the coordinator.\n Add checksum in persisted cluster topology to detect corruption\n Partition join request to non existing partition should be rejected\n\nAdditional improvements\n\nShould we specify which node is coordinator via Broker configs?\nShould we allow changing coordinator dynamically?"

You have to explicitly trigger scaling via the rest api.\n\nSome limitations/potential improvements:\n\nBroker 0 is the designated code to coordinate any topology changes. When Broker 0 is not available, no other broker can take over the responsibility. This means that any scaling operation can be done when Broker 0 is healthy. Potential improvement - allow overriding this via config. Further improvement, brokers can elect a coordinator themselves based on availability.\nCancelling a stuck scaling operation is tricky and dangerous."

Escaping happening in the first place is fine I believe as this is a JSON string and \\\\n is the standard way to encode newlines there.\nTo Reproduce\n\nDeploy + run test process\nSee double escaping happening in string inputs\n\nExpected behavior\nWe do the unescaping magic ourselves so that in user land no one needs to worry:\n\nI define an input mapping foo = \"a\\nb\"\nIn my job worker I see foo = \"a\\nb\"\n\nAs a more user un-friendly alternative we could consider: String inputs are escaped like expression inputs (no double escaping), we clearly document how escaped strings shall be worked with (and how un-escaping has to be done in user land). This is closer to the existing behavior.\nLog/Stacktrace\nnone.\nEnvironment:\n\nOS: Linux\nZeebe Version: 8.0.2\nConfiguration: nothing special\n\nSupport:\nSUPPORT-15887\nSUPPORT-17621\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nGoal: I can add or remove brokers to an existing Zeebe clusters while keeping the partitions count same.\nWhen a user provisioned the cluster for a specific workload and later the workload is increased, the cluster can be scaled by adding more brokers and moving some of the partitions to the new brokers. This gives more resources per partition which will then be able to handle the workload. Scaling this way is limited because it depends on how many partitions were initially provisioned. However, this is the first step towards dynamic scaling Zeebe to handle increased workloads.\nTask Breakdown\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

Will create issues for these later.\n\n Retry operations in TopologyChangeApplier or ClusterTopologyManager. Operations like partition join/leave can fail due to temporary issues like timeout, unavailability of leader. This should be retried.\n Add revapi to check backward compatibility issues with protobuf definitions in topology module\n Allow configuring cluster topology gossipper. Currently the configs such as sync interval, timeout etc.. are hard coded.\n Single member cannot leave a partition\n Engine factory should read partition count from ClusterTopology. Eventhough we don't allow change partition count yet, ClusterTopology is the source of truth. It should be possible to start a broker with wrong configuration, but it find the correct one from the coordinator.\n Add checksum in persisted cluster topology to detect corruption\n Partition join request to non existing partition should be rejected\n\nAdditional improvements\n\nShould we specify which node is coordinator via Broker configs?\nShould we allow changing coordinator dynamically?"

You have to explicitly trigger scaling via the rest api.\n\nSome limitations/potential improvements:\n\nBroker 0 is the designated code to coordinate any topology changes. When Broker 0 is not available, no other broker can take over the responsibility. This means that any scaling operation can be done when Broker 0 is healthy. Potential improvement - allow overriding this via config. Further improvement, brokers can elect a coordinator themselves based on availability.\nCancelling a stuck scaling operation is tricky and dangerous."

    "bodyText": "Introduction\n\nKeep your running instances up-to-date with the latest process improvements (public roadmap issue).\nProcess Instance Migration is a feature that is available in Camunda 7 that allows process instances to be 'migrated' to another process model. Typically, this is useful when the process definition needs to be changed due to bugs or new requirements. This epic aims to add basic process instance migration functionality for relatively simple process definitions.\nEfforts on this feature start from lessons learned from the following issues, where we identified several potential iterations. However, that concept was overthrown after spiking another approach where we don't cancel the process instance and create a new instance using the target process definition, but rather adjust the existing process instance in such a way that the keys (process instance key, job keys, etc) remain the same:\n\n#11099\n#14960\n\nThis means that Process Instance Migration will allow users to migrate an existing process instance to a new process definition, but this will come with certain restrictions. For example, the type of an activity cannot be changed when mapping it in the migration plan.\nUsers can use Cancel Process Instance in combination with Create and Start at a User-Defined Element to overcome the limitations of Process Instance Migration, at the cost of losing the original process instance and a re-creation of the associated keys.\nRequirements and limitations\nProcess instances can only be migrated under the following requirements and limitations. The reasoning for each statement can be found by expanding the details.\nProcess instance migration can only migrate active process instances, i.e. existing process instances that have not yet been completed, terminated, or banned\n\nTerminated and completed process instances are removed from Zeebe, so Zeebe has no knowledge about them anymore.\nBanned process instances still exist in Zeebe. However, they are isolated from active instances so that they don't cause further damage. Banned instances cannot be recovered, but allow investigation by Zeebe developers to troubleshoot severe bugs.\n\n \nAll active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes)\n\nWe require all active elements in a process instance to have an explicit mapping in the migration plan. This is also a requirement for active Sub Processes.\nWhen a Sub Process is added nesting a mapped active element, the engine assumes that the user wants to have a new element instance of that Sub Process. Likewise, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element is removed, the engine could assume that the user wants to remove the element instance of that Sub Process. However, when a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, the user likely wants to reuse the element instance of the Sub Process. For example, if variables exist at this Sub Process, they wouldn't expect to lose them.\nNow consider the case where a Sub Process nesting a mapped active element remains, but its element ID is changed. Should the engine consider this a different Sub Process from the active one, or does the user mean that this is the same Sub Process? There is no way for the engine to decide this for the user.\nTo highlight this, let's add one additional Sub Process to the target process nesting the Sub Process with the adjusted ID. In the example, we map Task A to A, what should happen to the instance of Sub Process Sub 1 and any variables existing on it?\n\n\nIf we recreate the Sub Process\n\nThe variables are lost\nOr the engine has to add logic to copy the variables automatically and choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3\n\n\nIf we adjust the Sub Process as Migrated\n\nThe engine has to choose between Sub 2 and Sub 3 as migration target and create an instance of the other\n\n\n\nIn both scenarios, the engine has to make a choice that it can't really make.\nThe alternative is to require users to provide a mapping for all active elements, including active Sub Processes. The engine can still assume to create new element instances for Sub Processes added to the hierarchy in the target process. When an active Sub Process is removed from the hierarchy, the user can provide an explicit mapping to:\n\na target Sub Process -> to migrate and keep the element instance\nno element \"\" (empty string) -> to terminate the element instance\n\nThis has several advantages:\n\nThe expected outcome of the migration plan is clear because the mappings are explicit\nIf the ID of a Sub Process is changed in a target process and the user forgets to map the Sub Process, it will otherwise lead to the loss of local variables existing at the Sub Process, or the engine has to make a choice for the user about copying the variables. This mistake could be easily made, so we should protect the user.\n\n\n \nMapping instructions cannot change the element type\n\nIf we would allow changing the element type, then type-specific expressions and entities may have to be created and/or removed depending on the mapping. This quickly leads to difficult situations.\nFor example, when mapping a service task to a user task, we'd have to remove the job, evaluate user-specific expressions (e.g. assignee), and create a new job with the new information, or adjust the existing job with the new info. If the type changes further from task to gateway, this also leads to more required changes. For Zeebe, it's best to keep this complexity under control and restrict how elements can be migrated.\nZeebe provides a way to move elements between elements of different types with the Process Instance Modification functionality. Users can modify and migrate a process instance in a two or three-step procedure:\n\nMigrate a process instance, keeping the active element unchanged and introducing a new element with a different type\nModify the process instance, moving the active element to the newly introduced element\nMigrate the process instance, removing the no longer needed element from the process\n\n\n \nThe target process definition must exist in Zeebe (deployed and not deleted)\n\nThis requirement should not raise any eyebrows. Zeebe must know what the target process looks like in order to migrate a process instance to it.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `sourceElementId` must refer to an element existing in the source process\n\nIf the mapping refers to a non-existing element id, then the user might have made a mistake in their mapping instructions. Instead of just accepting this, we prefer to point out the mistake. As process instance migration is a power tool, it's possible to damage a process instance. Therefore, we feel it's best to support the user wherever possible.\n\n \nA mapping instruction's `targetElementId` must refer to an element existing in the target process (or refer to no element, i.e. `\"\"` empty string)\n\nExactly similar to the point above about sourceElementId, with one exception: if the mapping refers to a Sub Process, it's possible to remove the element instance by referring to no target element. See the discussion about All active elements require a mapping (including active Sub Processes) above.\n\n \nAdditional limitations\nThis epic will be limited as it only provides basic functionality and focuses on simpler process definitions. However, these are not requirements and may be changed later.\nThe number of active leaf element instances (i.e. tasks, events, gateways) stays the same\n\nWe may add support in future versions for removing or adding leaf element instances through specific mapping instructions, but we believe that this makes the feature unnecessarily complex. Users can use Process Instance Modification to remove or add element instances to a process instance and can combine it with Process Instance Migration in a multi-step procedure to deal with this. See the discussion on Mapping instructions cannot change the element type for an example of such a procedure changing step 2 to remove or add an element instance.\n\n\nConcept\nA new MigrateProcessInstance RPC will be added to Zeebe's Gateway to allow clients to migrate process instances. This RPC requires specifying a migration plan. This migration plan consists of mapping instructions specifying how active elements in the source process are migrated to elements in the target process.\nA simple migration example is migrating an active Service Task A to a process with that same Service Task A and a Service Task B after it. The mapping instructions specify that A is mapped to A. After the migration, the process instance is still waiting at Service Task A, and when completing its Job the process flows to Service Task B.\n\nReference-level details\n\nWe'll introduce a new MigrateProcessInstance RPC. This API allows for defining a migration plan consisting of a target process definition and a set of mapping instructions. Each instruction looks like [source element id -> target element id]. The RPC takes a MigrateProcessInstanceRequest similar to the following structure (note that the naming and structure are not yet definitive):\nmessage MigrateProcessInstanceRequest {\n  // key of process instance to migrate\n  int64 processInstanceKey = 1;\n\n  MigrationPlan migrationPlan = 2;\n\n  message MigrationPlan {\n    // the process definition key to migrate to\n    int64 targetProcessDefinitionKey = 1;\n    // source (to migrate from) element id and target element id (to migrate to)\n    repeated MappingInstruction mappingInstructions = 2;\n  }\n\n  message MappingInstruction {\n    // the element id to migrate from\n    string sourceElementId = 1;\n    // the element id to migrate to\n    string targetElementId = 2;\n  }\n}\nWhen migrating an instance, we adjust the active element instances in Zeebe's state using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. These make sure that the following information is updated:\n\nprocessDefinitionKey: the key of the target process definition\nbpmnProcessId: the BPMN ID of the target process definition\nversion: the version of the target process definition\nelementId: changes to the mapped element ID (note that the mapping may define the sourceElementId and the targetElementId as equivalent, in which case it stays the same)\nflowScopeKey: may change if the element exists within a different (sub)-process in the target process definition, e.g. when a new sub-process wraps the element or when a wrapping sub-process is removed in the diff between the source and target process definitions)\n\nSimilarly, we will adjust other entities:\n\njobs with Job:MIGRATED\nvariables with Variable:MIGRATED\nincidents with Incident:MIGRATED\n(eventually) event subscriptions like Timer:MIGRATED and SignalSubscription:MIGRATED, but these are kept out-of-scope initially by recreating event subscriptions\n\nIn the following example, both the element instance of the Process and the element instance of the active Service Task A are adjusted using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events. The Job associated with Service Task A is also adjusted using a Job:MIGRATED event. If any Process Variables exist on the process instance, then these are adjusted using Variable:MIGRATED events.\n\nWe also need to adjust the internal entities (these exist in the state only and don't have their own associated records):\n\nEvent Scope Instance, requires changes to interrupting and boundary element ids\nEventTrigger, requires changes to elementId (but likely does not require adjustment for migrated instances)\n\nSuch internal entities can either:\n\nbe adjusted through the ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED events\nbe promoted to have their own records so they can be adjusted through *:MIGRATED events\n\nNote that any entities introduced for new features will also need MIGRATED events to be adjusted. For example:\n\n#14938\n#14920\n#11217\n\nChanging the element hierarchy\nMigrated activities do not have to remain descendants of their closest migrating ancestor scope (Hierarchy Preservation) like in Camunda 7. Instead, a Sub Process can be added in the target process, nesting an element active in the source process. Zeebe will assume that the user intends to create a new element instance of the Sub Process that can be used as the ancestor scope of the active element.\nIn the following example, we see that element instance B is mapped to an element B that is nested inside A New Sub Process. A new element instance (with a new key) will be created for the element A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATING and ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_ACTIVATED. The flow scope (i.e. ancestor scope) of the element instance B is then adjusted to the key of the newly created instance of A New Sub Process using ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be added simultaneously.\n\nLikewise, a Sub Process in the source process may be removed in the target process. Zeebe will assume that the ancestor scope of the removed Sub Process instance can be used as the ancestor scope of any element active in that Sub Process.\nThis is recursive behavior, meaning that multiple nesting Sub Processes can be removed simultaneously.\n\nTask Breakdown #\n\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

variables of sub-processes when the scope hierarchy changes?\nIn Camunda7, there is a requirement for hierarchy preservation. It may be, that we don't have this same requirement in Zeebe. However, this lack presents ambiguity when it comes to copying variables of sub-processes.\nA potential solution would be introducing Variable Mapping Instructions to the Migration Plan, where the user can specify exactly where to move variables when removing a Sub Process from the hierarchy.\nThis functionality can be kept out of scope for now.\nHow should we deal with process instances in non-wait states?\nWhen the engine completes an element and flows to the next element, it:\n\nmarks the element as completed\nmarks the outgoing sequence flow as taken\nand appends a command to activate the next element for the process instance\n\nThis means that there are moments in time when an element is not active in the state. Rather the sequence flow is taken, and a not-yet-processed command describes the continuation of the process execution.\nAfter migrating the instance, such unprocessed commands will still be attempted to be processed, but they will be rejected because they refer to the now terminated source process instance.\nThis scenario also exists for Process Instance Modification, as the referenced process instance key stays the same for both modification and migration. However, parts of the process instance could be terminated, for which unprocessed commands could also be rejected.\nFor Process Instance Migration, other information (e.g. process definition key) has changed since the command was appended. What we could do to resolve this, is to never trust this data in ProcessInstance commands and always look up the current process definition by doing a lookup of the element instance by key. By trusting the state over the data in commands, we may be able to process more commands correctly.\nStill, an element activation command may be unprocessed targeting a no longer existing element id. In that case, the command will simply be rejected. The user may need to use Process Instance Modification to rectify the process instance state.\nThis scenario might not be too problematic, as it only affects non-wait states. Migration is typically done from wait state to wait state (e.g. user task to user task, service task to service task, etc), where the process has already reached that specific point and is awaiting further instructions from the client. For the cases where this affects non-wait states, modification can be used by the user to rectify any tokens lost during migration. In the future, process instance suspension may be used to stop process execution and increase the user's control over the process migration.\nLinks\n\n\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1470\nProduct Hub (internal): camunda/product-hub#1829",

    "bodyText": "Introduction\nWe execute tasks in our processes that sometimes have to be canceled later under certain circumstances. BPMN compensation events and compensation handlers are a very powerful construct for handling such situations.\nWithout these BPMN symbols, users would have to add a lot of additional complexity to their models.\n\nConcept\n\nBPMN compensation events are part of the BPMN 2.0 standard (chapter 13.4.5 Compensation, page 441).\nIn this iteration, we plan to implement the following features of compensation events:\n\nAdd support for compensation events:\n\nCompensation boundary events\nCompensation intermediate throw events\nCompensation end events\nCompensation start events (i.e. compensation event subprocesses)\n\n\nMark activities for compensation (i.e. compensation handlers):\n\nService Tasks\nUser Tasks\nSend Tasks\nScript Tasks\nManual Tasks\nUndefined Tasks\n\n\nTrigger compensation recursively for subprocesses\nAccess local variables (i.e. snapshot data) from completed subprocesses\nTrigger compensation for a given activity (i.e. instead of implicitly for the current scope)\n\nCompensation subscriptions\nIn order to compensate an activity, we need to keep track of completed activities with a compensation handler.
