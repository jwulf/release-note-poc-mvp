A signal can‚Äôt be broadcast, as it must define on which tenant it will start process instances or be caught in existing ones.\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

like process instances and jobs. The intention is to provide multi-tenancy support for these concepts early in the implementation so that other Camunda Platform 8 components are unblocked, and can start implementing multi-tenancy on their side as well.\nEach task of phase 2 covers the vertical implementation (engine, gateway, client, data migration, documentation) for a Zeebe concept. The vertical implementation of the deployments functionality can serve as an example.\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

    "body": "Description\nFor multi-tenancy, the goal of the Zeebe Gateway is to:\n\nProvide data on the user's authorized tenants.\nForward this data (through the RecordMetadata) to the Zeebe Broker through a Broker*Request instance.\n\nFull support for multi-tenancy in the Zeebe gateway will be provided once camunda-cloud/identity#1819 is completed.\nFor this issue, the Zeebe Gateway should (only) support the following:\n\nProvide a Gateway configuration flag: zeebe.gateway.multiTenancy.enabled - default FALSE (disabled)\n\nThe flag should toggle multi-tenancy for the Zeebe cluster.\nAn enabled flag is preferred, as we will probably add additional multi-tenancy configuration properties in the future.\n\n\nExpand the IdentityInterceptor class. After the token is successfully verified the following should be performed:\n\nProvide a list of tenant ids the user has access to:\n\nIf multi-tenancy is disabled, the list should only contain the <default> tenant id (see #13235)\nIf multi-tenancy is enabled, the Identity SDK should be used to fetch the list of tenant ids (out-of-scope for this issue)\n\n\n[Proposal] Place the list of tenant IDs in a gRPC context to be forwarded to the EndpointManager/RequestMapper (consider doing it through a helper class).\n\n\nWe should provide a general (auth) API that the IdentityInterceptor class will implement. The goal is to provide an Identity-independent use of multi-tenancy, i.e. users can use a multi-tenant Zeebe without the need of Camunda Identity.\n\nAC:\n  \n    \n      \n  \n      \n        \n    \n\n      \n    \n      The content you are editing has changed.

      "@koevskinikola & @korthout,\n\n\n[...] After the token is successfully verified the following should be performed:\n\nProvide a list of tenant ids the user has access to:\n\nIf multi-tenancy is disabled, the list should only contain the  tenant id (see #13235)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes that mean, that if tenancy is disabled, it will still ask Identity to provide a list of tenants?\nAnd another question: What happens if tenancy is disabled and Identity is not configured (i.e., Zeebe is used \"standalone\")? Does the Gateway still provide the default tenant to include it in the respective broker requests?",
      "if tenancy is disabled, it will still ask Identity to provide a list of tenants?\n\nI don't think so, because that's the behavior when multi-tenancy is enabled.\n\nIf multi-tenancy is enabled, the Identity SDK should be used to fetch the list of tenant ids\n\nApart from the description, I would also find it very odd if Identity is still asked.\n\n\nWhat happens if tenancy is disabled and Identity is not configured (i.e., Zeebe is used \"standalone\")? Does the Gateway still provide the default tenant to include it in the respective broker requests?\n\nI would assume that the default tenant would be added to the tenant access ids list, so it can be used in the broker requests where the default tenant is assumed when multi-tenancy is disabled. This means data isolation can be guaranteed.",
      "I moved #14285 out of scope and will link it to a different issue.",
      "@abbasadel I've marked #14286 as closing this issue. I think that's fine for Zeebe, as #14307 is Helm Charts related and not blocking Zeebe.",
