The following methods were added to support the addition of `tenantId`: `DeployResource`, `CreateProcessInstance`, `PublishMessage`, `BroadcastSignal`, `EvaluateDecision` and for multiple `tenantIds`, the `ActivateJobs` method.\n Now, Zeebe Go client users are able to specify a `tenantId` and `tenantIds` in their commands.

The migration was difficult as the event subscriptions could exist on partitions outside of the process instance, resulting in the breakdown of the migration process and causing inconvenience for users.\nThe underlying cause of this problem was due to the distinction between the process instance and the partitions where event subscriptions could reside. This made the migration process of existing event subscriptions challenging.\nTo resolve this issue, an approach was implemented which involved unsubscribing each active element instance in the process instance and subscribing to new events in the target process for each migrated element instance.\nNow, users can successfully migrate process instances even when there are event subscriptions in both the original and target processes, leading to more efficient and seamless transitions."

Hence, events related to BPMN compensation such as compensation intermediate throwing events, compensation end events, compensation boundary events, and compensation start events were all missing the required `COMPENSATION` event type.\n We introduced a new `COMPENSATION` event type in `BpmnEventType.java` to reflect the execution of compensation events accurately in the BPMN process. \n Now, all events related to a BPMN compensation event are accurately tagged with the `COMPENSATION` event type.

This lack of leadership was detrimental for the stable functioning of the system, with no additional details visible in the logs.\n \nThe underlying mechanism for electing a new leader for the partition was faulty. The system was expecting a non-null value for the current leader term, but instead found a null value, which led to the update failure.\n \nWe introduced a robust system to correctly perform the leadership election, ensuring that null values would not be encountered during a new leader's assignment.\n \nNow, whenever there is a need for a new leader in a partition, the system successfully updates the leader. This improved mechanism ensures the seamless functioning of the system."

This led to widespread DNS failures and, ultimately, disk space depletion as data could not be exported anymore. \nThe underlying issue was found in the Java process where the amounts of open UDP connections were constantly on the rise. This unusual pattern conflicted with the expected baseline of 2 open UDP connections related to our Netty unicast service and some temporary ones.\nThe issue was resolved by addressing the UDP resource leaks in the Java process. Modifications were implemented to ensure that the number of UDP connections didn't exceed the baseline.\nNow, the system correctly sustains only the baseline UDP connections, eliminating the previous resource leak. Consequently, DNS failures related to this issue are avoided and data export functions normally, preventing disk space fill up."

Now, they no longer rely solely on the last modification reflected in the internal buffer.\nWith the fix applied, client streams that are logically equivalent are now correctly aggregated on the gateway.

Additionally, there was no handling for potential scenarios where there may be a null or empty baseUrl which would render the search feature unusable.\nA helper function was added to determine the availability of the identity user search feature considering the identity configuration type, as well as checking for null or empty baseUrl.\nThe system now ensures the user search feature is available before allowing it to be used in the Optimize UI. It correctly hides this functionality if it's not usable based on system configuration or if the baseUrl is empty or null."

If a user attempted to broadcast a signal for an unauthorized tenant, or if the provided tenant-id was either missing, invalid, or not allowed due to disabled multi-tenancy, the system returned errors such as PERMISSION_DENIED or INVALID_ARGUMENT.\nThe errors were caused due to the lack of multi-tenancy support in the `BroadcastSignalCommand`. This meant that user actions involving tenant authorization or identification could lead to system errors because the system wasn't equipped to correctly process multi-tenant identities.\nThe issue was resolved by augmenting the `BroadcastSignalCommand` with a multi-tenancy feature. This fix included exposing an optional `tenantId` property/method, which facilitated the system's ability to handle actions involving multiple tenants.\nWith the enhanced `BroadcastSignalCommand`, users can now reliably broadcast tenant-aware signals via the Java client without running into issues. The system is equipped to handle cases of unauthorized broadcast attempts, missing or invalid tenant-id inputs, and properly discerns whether multi-tenancy is enabled or disabled."

The lack of this feature increased the potential for server-overload, as the client would repeatedly attempt to poll for jobs in the face of sustained networking errors. \n The Go client has been updated to include the same backoff mechanism as found in the Java client. This includes a default exponential backoff, optional configurability, and the ability for users to provide their own backoff strategy. The backoff kicks in upon encountering errors during the poll for available jobs.\n The Go client now experiences a delay in subsequent job polling attempts whenever an error is received from the gateway. This backoff feature helps avoid server overload and provides users with more control over the backoff strategy. The polling process is now more resilient to sustained networking errors."

    "releaseNoteText": "Users that created an implementation of the `ZeebeClientProperties` returning `null` for the `getDefaultJobWorkerName` experienced a `NullPointerException`. This was due to the constructor of `ActivateJobsCommandImpl` attempting to set a `workerName` during construction, even if it was null.\nThe issue arose from the constructor not having the ability to handle null values. This null value handling was expected from the builder pattern used previously, which allowed clients to set `workerName` after constructing the command. Furthermore, this issue was inadvertently introduced during a transition from request to command builder.\nThe system was amended to allow the builder to fallback to the default worker name only if it wasn't set by a client during the final command construction. This methodology sidestepped forcing a non-null value set during the constructor phase of the `ActivateJobsCommandImpl`.\nNow, users can develop implementations of `ZeebeClientProperties` that return `null` for `getDefaultJobWorkerName` without fear of causing a `NullPointerException`. This is because the constructor of `ActivateJobsCommandImpl` now effectively handles null values."

The system's logs referenced a missing function, but this information was inaccessible to users who lacked access to the logs.\n We have updated our system to append warnings gathered from the evaluation of FEEL expressions into the resulting incident messages, providing the user with actionable insights into the problems with their instances.\n Now, when a user creates an instance using an incorrectly formatted FEEL expression, the resulting incident message will clearly list the issues with the expression, making it easier for the user to rectify the problem. In turn, this improves the usability of our system and lessens user frustration."

Furthermore, using the GitHub repo token to query the project led to an absence of results because the repo token had no access to projects.\n The issue originated from the way variables were set in the programming code, an incorrect assumption that the result of the `has-project` step was a boolean, and the use of the GitHub repo token instead of the project admin token for the project query.\n The variable settings were refined, solving the initial warning. The condition checks for the`has-project` step were corrected to anticipate a string outcome instead of a boolean, and the project admin token was used in the project query instead of the GitHub repo token.\n As of this version, users no longer come across a warning about variable settings in the 'add to projects' workflow.

    "releaseNoteText": " In the past, job worker back pressure was considered an error state and was logged at an error level. This could cause confusion as it was an expected state rather than an error. Also, the logic for pushing to the client from the gateway was incorporated in the `AggregatedClientStream` and `ClientStreamImpl` classes, which made them more complex than necessary and could slow down their efficiency.\n Back pressure was incorrectly interpreted as an error, leading to excessive error logging. This problem arose due to the function of job yielding on the broker side triggering logs at the error level when back pressure occurred. Additionally, the `AggregatedClientStream` and `ClientStreamImpl` classes were overloaded with logic beyond their data classes purpose; they contained the logic for pushing data to the client from the gateway.\n We downgraded the job worker back pressure from an error state to an expected state, modifying the system logs to trace level instead of error level and focusing more on metrics for tracking frequent blockages. The logic for pushing to the client from the gateway was moved out of the `AggregatedClientStream` and `ClientStreamImpl` classes into a dedicated class, `ClientStreamPusher`.\n When back pressure is encountered, it's now treated as an expected state, not an error state, and logs regarding this matter are generated at the trace level. This can improve debugging as error logs are now more representative of unexpected issues. Furthermore, with the segregation of the push-to-client logic into its own class, the `AggregatedClientStream` and `ClientStreamImpl` classes are now just data classes providing a clearer and more efficient structure."

    "releaseNoteText": " Previously, users faced difficulty in end-to-end testing with Zeebe. The system was overly-sensitive to faults as the Identity snapshot version could change at any time. The problem was compounded when needing to support older versions, resulting in skew as the old software development kit (SDK) did not align with the snapshot version. \n The issue was rooted in the lack of implementation information in the MANIFEST.MF of the jar. The absence of this information made it challenging to determine the Identity version used in other projects that depend on this SDK during runtime. \n We added the required implementation information inside the MANIFEST.MF of the jar. This addition ensures that the Identity version being used in other projects that depend on this SDK is accessible during runtime. \n Now users can effortlessly retrieve the version they depend on during runtime and utilize this for a Docker image in their end-to-end tests. This improvement significantly enhances the end-to-end testing process with Zeebe by ensuring alignment with snapshot versions and effectively supporting older versions."

    "releaseNoteText": " Previously, the system did not support initializing access rules via configurations. As a result, difficulties were faced by internal teams and customers during automation tasks due to the complexity of manually assigning members to tenants.\n The issue arose because the system's ability to automatically create tenants and assign members to them using configuration was not developed, which could have led to unnecessary manual intervention \n A change was implemented in the initializer to support creation of tenants and assigning members to these tenants via configuration. Also, protection was added to avoid the default tenant from being overwritten and removed, avoiding any future inconsistencies.\n Now, the system supports initializing access rules through configuration, simplifying the process of automation. The `<default>` tenant is protected and cannot be overwritten or removed, ensuring the environment stability."

Setting the versions via a 'dependencyManagement' block did not resolve the issue. \nThe issue was addressed in two ways: (1) the Jupiter versions were set to a version that works properly and (2) the maven failsafe plugin was configured to fail the build if no tests are run during the verification stage for the management-api artifact.\nNow, as a measure of robustness, even if there are no integration tests that run during the validation phase in the 'management-api' module, the build fails (unless the tests are skipped using '-DskipTests=true'). This change ensures our builds return to a credible position."

The lack of this feature increased the potential for server-overload, as the client would repeatedly attempt to poll for jobs in the face of sustained networking errors. \n The Go client has been updated to include the same backoff mechanism as found in the Java client. This includes a default exponential backoff, optional configurability, and the ability for users to provide their own backoff strategy. The backoff kicks in upon encountering errors during the poll for available jobs.\n The Go client now experiences a delay in subsequent job polling attempts whenever an error is received from the gateway.

The issue was rectified by correctly associating the metrics with their respective containers and services.\n Currently, all nodes perform with the expected IOPS, providing accurate and consistent benchmarks.

The leader in the group was tracking configuration indices of members inaccurately, particularly when members lost configurations due to data loss or uncommitted configurations, leading to a need to restart the leader or create a new configuration for resolution.\n This was caused by the system only updating the configuration index when receiving a successful configuration response. This method failed to account for instances where the leaders' understanding of members' configuration index remained outdated or nonexistent due to various disruptions.\n We introduced changes in the communication between the leader and members. Now, the append response contains the configuration index, enabling the leader to update the index as it receives an append response. Additionally, followers can signal to the leader when a configuration is outdated or missing. Further, we enabled followers to reject append requests in the absence of a current configuration. As for backwards compatibility, we did accommodate older versions of followers who do not send a configuration index. \n As a result of these changes, the system now provides a more robust replication group configuration management. Leaders can accurately determine and update the configuration status of members, making the system more resilient to disruptions. The process is also streamlined for followers, as they have the option to decline append requests if they cannot determine a current configuration.

Additionally, if the `import-position` index was randomly deleted, the post importer could not flush its position. Errors would occur during incident post processing if parent process instances and flow node instances were missing.\n These issues arose because Operate initially did not check if aliases were present when checking the completeness of a schema. Furthermore, the post importer used an `update` query instead of `upsert` when flushing its position to the `import-position`. Lastly, errors during incident post processing occurred because certain missing elements were not taken into account.\n We corrected the aforementioned issues by adding a check for the presence of aliases when evaluating the completeness of the schema. If any aliases were missing, they were added. We also switched the post importer to use an `upsert` query instead of `update` to allow for the potential for randomly deleted data. Lastly, we included a flag, `postImporterIgnoreMissingParents=true/false` (default: false), to overlook errors during incident post processing and we added warnings to log when parent process instances and flow node instances are missing during an import.\n Now Operate can continue running after experiencing data loss. The post importer is able to flush its position even if data is randomly deleted from the `import-position` index. Furthermore, with the new flag, errors during incident post processing can be ignored, allowing the process to continue.

The application attempted to access the DatabaseInfo bean before it was entirely created, leading to an unsuccessful static method call.\n During the construction of SessionService, the postConstruct method initiated a scheduled deletion of expired session IDs. This action provoked one of the SessionRepository beans to make a static method call to DatabaseInfo.getCurrent() during bean creation. Consequently, when the DatabaseInfo bean was not fully created yet, this resulted in an application crash due to a Null Pointer Exception (NPE). \n The problem was traced and fixed by controlling the bean creation order. A dependency was inserted into AbstractIndexDescriptor, forcing Spring to fully create DatabaseInfo before any components extending AbstractIndexDescriptor. Additionally, a NullPointerException guard was put in place in DatabaseInfo's isCurrent() and a log statement was added to indicate if this function is called before the applicationContext has been set.\n Following these modifications, the issue with premature access to the DatabaseInfo bean and resulting Null Pointer Exception (NPE) has been rectified. Now, if the application calls the isCurrent() function before setting the applicationContext, it creates an alert. Consequently, the system runs smoothly without crashing due to inappropriately timed method calls on not fully instantiated beans."

Additionally, there was no handling for potential scenarios where there may be a null or empty baseUrl which would render the search feature unusable.\nA helper function was added to determine the availability of the identity user search feature considering the identity configuration type, as well as checking for null or empty baseUrl.\nThe system now ensures the user search feature is available before allowing it to be used in the Optimize UI. It correctly hides this functionality if it's not usable based on system configuration or if the baseUrl is empty or null."

This meant that user actions involving tenant authorization or identification could lead to system errors because the system wasn't equipped to correctly process multi-tenant identities.\nThe issue was resolved by augmenting the `BroadcastSignalCommand` with a multi-tenancy feature.

As a result, the specific type of catch event that was contributing to the lag wasn't identifiable in Grafana's 'General Overview -> Current Events' view. \n We added the type of catch events to Grafana's 'General Overview -> Current Events' view.

This hampered the ability for different tenants to broadcast their own distinct signals, resulting in a lack of necessary separation and potential confusion when handling multiple processes.\n \nThe underlying issue was that the `SignalSubscriptionState` could not persist the `tenantId`, and the engine was unable to process `SignalRecord` commands with a tenant ID. This led to a lack of multi-tenancy support in the ProcessingStates used by signal broadcasting.\n \nWe modified the `SignalSubscriptionState` to accommodate the `tenantId`, and updated the engine to process `SignalRecord` commands with a tenant ID. We also provided multi-tenancy data migration for the ProcessingStates used by signal broadcasting. Further, the Elasticsearch/Opensearch record templates were updated to include a `tenantId` property.\n \nZeebe now correctly supports multi-tenancy for BPMN signal events. Each tenant can broadcast their own specific signals, enabling clearer process definition and control across different tenants. The addition of the `tenantId` property facilitates identification and streamlines multi-tenant operations."

This led to a restart of the term from 1, potentially causing inconsistencies in cases where the term of the last entry in the log was greater than 1. An increase in disk usage was also observed as no new snapshots could be taken until the term was elevated to a value higher than the one before the backup.\n A solution to this problem was implemented in [PR#15272](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15272).\n With the introduced fix, users should no longer see inconsistencies in the Raft protocol after restoring from a backup.

The problem exacerbated when brokers led more than one partition, resulting in concurrent untenable mutations of an `ArrayProperty`.\nThe issue was resolved with a dual-approach fix. Firstly, a 'quick-fix' was implemented, which surfaced as cloning the job activation properties in `BpmnJobActivationBehavior` before retrieving the list of tenants. This cloning enabled the isolation of multiple partitions and their operations over the `ArrayProperty`. Secondly, an additional maintenance-friendly fix was prepared, wherein the engine was wrapped with a partition-aware facade that can duplicate information when needed, keeping redundancy at bay.\nFollowing the implementation of these fixes, users no longer experience `MsgpackReaderException` during job push operations. The system stability and performance in brokers leading multiple partitions are now enhanced, as concurrent mutations are avoided, and job push operations are functional again. Clients can use the system more effectively, and job push operations can seamlessly proceed without disruptions.\n"

Additionally, the `IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED` feature flag was not set, limiting usability concerning instance migrations.\n \nDevelopers refactored the `InstancesList`, added the feature flag `IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED` and built a `MigrationView` component. They also added processInstanceMigrationStore to aid the migration process. The visual regression tests were updated to pass when `IS_INSTANCE_MIGRATION_ENABLED` is false.\n \nUsers can now navigate through the instance migration process with ease. The system now features navigation buttons including back, next and confirm as described in the design, improving usability and system navigation. As for styling, it will be implemented in a future update."

Certain Plans were under-utilised and the index settings of Opensearch were not properly configured.\n The issue was caused due to the incomplete implementation of certain functionalities including `ReindexPlan`, `ReindexWithQueryAndScriptPlan`, `FillPostImporterQueuePlan`. Furthermore, misconfiguration of index settings for Opensearch was also a contributing factor.\n To address this, several key components have been implemented such as `ReindexPlan`, `ReindexWithQueryAndScriptPlan`, `FillPostImporterQueuePlan`. Index settings for Opensearch were corrected and ReindexIT was refactored to support tests for both Opensearch and Elasticsearch. The `ReindexPlan::buildScript` was removed due to it being redundant.\n Now, Opensearch migrations are more flexible and utilize the `ReindexPlan`, `ReindexWithQueryAndScriptPlan`, `FillPostImporterQueuePlan` functionalities. The index settings for Opensearch are properly configured, ensuring improved performance and reliability. The tests work seamlessly for both Opensearch and Elasticsearch without unnecessary functions."

The problem was compounded when needing to support older versions, resulting in skew as the old software development kit (SDK) did not align with the snapshot version. \n The issue was rooted in the lack of implementation information in the MANIFEST.MF of the jar. The absence of this information made it challenging to determine the Identity version used in other projects that depend on this SDK during runtime. \n We added the required implementation information inside the MANIFEST.MF of the jar. This addition ensures that the Identity version being used in other projects that depend on this SDK is accessible during runtime. \n Now users can effortlessly retrieve the version they depend on during runtime and utilize this for a Docker image in their end-to-end tests. This improvement significantly enhances the end-to-end testing process with Zeebe by ensuring alignment with snapshot versions and effectively supporting older versions."

Also, protection was added to avoid the default tenant from being overwritten and removed, avoiding any future inconsistencies.\n Now, the system supports initializing access rules through configuration, simplifying the process of automation. The `<default>` tenant is protected and cannot be overwritten or removed, ensuring the environment stability."
