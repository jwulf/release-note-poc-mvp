    "gitHubText": "**Describe the bug**\n\nAs a user I want to pass special chars in strings ([FEEL ref](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/feel/language-guide/feel-data-types/#string)) in a way that I can consume them in a job worker.\n\nI've defined the following input mappings:\n\n| name | value |\n|:---|:---|\n| dynamic_input | `= \"Hello\\n\\nYOU!\"` |\n| static_input | `Hello\\n\\nYOU!` |\n| static_input_explicit_newlines | `HELLO<newline><newline>YOU!` |\n\nExecuting my process I receive the following input variable values in operate (but also in my process worker):\n\n\n| name | value |\n|:---|:---|\n| dynamic_input | `\"Hello\\\\n\\\\nYOU!\"` |\n| static_input | `\"Hello\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYOU!\"` |\n| static_input_explicit_newlines | `\"Hello\\\\n\\\\nYOU!\"` |\n\nAs you can see inputs are escaped differently depending on whether I use `\\n` encoded newlines or actual newline characters. Escaping happening in the first place is fine I believe as this is a JSON string and `\\\\n` is the standard way to encode newlines there.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n* Deploy + run [test process](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/files/9159826/input-test.bpmn.txt)\n* See double escaping happening in string inputs\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nWe do the unescaping magic ourselves so that in user land no one needs to worry:\n\n  * I define an input mapping `foo = \"a\\nb\"`\n  * In my job worker I see `foo = \"a\\nb\"`\n\nAs a more user un-friendly alternative we could consider: String inputs are escaped like expression inputs (no double escaping), we clearly document how escaped strings shall be worked with (and how un-escaping has to be done in user land). This is closer to the existing behavior.\n\n\n**Log/Stacktrace**\n\nnone.\n\n**Environment:**\n- OS: Linux\n- Zeebe Version: 8.0.2\n- Configuration: nothing special\n\nSupport: \n[SUPPORT-15887](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-15887)\n[SUPPORT-17621](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-17621)\n\n\n```[tasklist]\n### Tasks\n- [ ] https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15445\n- [ ] https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15447\n- [ ] https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15446\n- [x] Highlight the new behavior change in the release notes \n- [x] Inform the support team\n- [x] Update the [input mappings docs](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3020).\n```\n\n\n nikku: To add to this I see zeebe escaping unicode characters (i.e. `🤩`) despite JSON having full unicode support.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHello\\n\\nYOU! 🤩\r\n```\r\n\r\nturns into \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Hello\\\\n\\\\nYOU! \\uD83E\\uDD29\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n`\"Hello\\\\n\\\\nYOU! 🤩\"` is a valid JSON string.\n nikku: Is there a chance this can be fixed at some point? Or do we regard this as a nasty-bug-turned-public-api?\n menski: @felix-mueller this is something which mostly effects connectors but it is very unexpected behavior. We would like to understand if you have any input on priority for this.\n felix-mueller: It should be fixed at some point. Since we still need to root-cause and better understand the issue it is probably not S. We won't priotize it for the next few iterations (first we need to finish instance modification, DMN evaluation and delete definitions).\n menski: Thanks Felix, I put the priority on \"Later\" for now\n darox: I don't know whether I'm hitting the same issue. I'm using the Go client to ingest JSON formatted data into Zeebe. Jobs are failing due to escaped double quotes. If I set vars manually via simple-monitor everything works as expected. \n igpetrov: Hi team, is there any ETA to fix this? It is affecting currently 3 connectors.\n felix-mueller: @igpetrov currently we have planned to look into it after instance modification, DMN evaluation and Delete Definitions. these topics are scheduled to be included in our April minor release, so if we don't change priorities we probably will look at it in a few months.\r\n\r\nfrom connectors perspective can we live with this for a few months?\n igpetrov: Hi @felix-mueller, appreciate your update. Absolutely. Just wanted to understand the ETA. Thank you!\n tmetzke: For reference, in Connectors, we currently do the following to work around this with data we receive as variables after Zeebe has processed the user input:\r\n```\r\nStringEscapeUtils.unescapeJson(jsonStringVariable)\r\n```\r\nThis uses `StringEscapeUtils` from `org.apache.commons:commons-text`.\n nikku: @felix-mueller The longer we keep such behavior in the core, the harder it will be for people to unbuild their hacks (trying to work with zeebe data). My :two: :coin:.\n nikku: A similar issue is reported by a customer through [SUPPORT-15887](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-15887). \n nikku: I've updated the issue with a clear expected behavior, reflecting https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-15887, but also https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/9859#issuecomment-1318121197 have reported.\n menski: Discussed in the planning meeting on 2023-02-17. Right now we don't have capacity to work on this, and deprioritize it as the customer has a workaround available.\n korthout: When we work on this, we need to make sure not to break user space when backporting it to patches. We can do this by adding a configuration setting that allows switching between the current (broken) and new (fixed) behaviors. The default should stay the same in patch releases, but in a minor release we can change the default. This should be clearly communicated in the release notes (and blog) so users understand the change.\n abbasadel: This issue was mentioned again in [SUPPORT-17621](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-17621) and blocking connectors team's [here](https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle/issues/239)\n korthout: When we resolve this issue, please verify whether the fix also resolves:\r\n- https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13551\n Benjoyo: Also came across this, the `StringEscapeUtils.unescapeJson` workaround works for now but would be nice to have this fixed soon :)\n mschoe: I run into this issue when using the GH outbound connector and create a new issue with a multi line description field.  As this is a quite common use case I'm wondering when we are planning to provide a fix. @felix-mueller is this still scheduled for the 8.5 release in April 2024? \n christian-konrad: Would https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1040 help here or is it just a quick fix on string behavior?\n saig0: @nicpuppa started to work on this issue by fixing the escaping in the FEEL engine [here](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750). We plan to deliver a fix in one of the next patch releases. :rocket: \r\n\r\n@christian-konrad the FEEL templating is a bigger topic. Let's fix the issue with the escaping first. :+1: \n christian-konrad: Perfect @saig0 ! Thanks\n MaxTru: Hi @abbasadel ,\r\n\r\naccording to the [previous assessment](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/9859#issuecomment-1805096523) this should have been fixed with this [version bump](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/commit/4a90c77137dcad51106ee1e2fa8d1172c12640c2). Can you verify from Zeebe perspective please and update this issue? Thanks\n megglos: We need to clarify whether this change is breaking, especially in regards to present workaround in other components such as https://github.com/camunda/connector-slack/issues/48 &\r\nhttps://github.com/camunda/connector-google-drive/issues/20\r\nWhile for the REST connector no workaround seems to be in place and there a patch by zeebe would resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nIf it's breaking we may prefer to only release it in the next minor or at least coordinate with the affected components to remove the workaround applied for a patch. But then we have the risk that we have a dependency between patch levels of connectors and zeebe.\r\n\r\n@abbasadel will sync with @saig0 on this tomorrow and ping back.\n abbasadel: Hi everyone, this is Zeebe's assessment: \r\n- The recent [bug fix](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750) on the FEEL engine is not backward compatible from Zeebe's point of view. However, we believe, based on @saig0’s feedback and our tests, the impact on our users is low since the recommended workaround we provided was to use [unescapeJson API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringEscapeUtils.html#unescapeJson-java.lang.String-) from Apache Commons which handles breaking change.\r\n- As the previous behavior was wrong, mentioning the new behavior change in the release notes and as an announcement would be needed\r\n- This FEEL fix should resolve [bug](https://github.com/camunda/connectors/issues/239), to be validated by Connectors/Operate teams. \r\n- The support team should also be aware of this FEEL behavior change once release\r\n\r\n\r\n\n MaxTru: > Hi everyone, this is Zeebe's assessment:\r\n> \r\n> * The recent [bug fix](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750) on the FEEL engine is not backward compatible from Zeebe's point of view.

Will you and the ZPA team please ensure that all these things happen? If so, can we please track this via a breakdown and DRI assignments? Why is the issue not in `in progress` and has no assignee?\n abbasadel: @MaxTru, we will take care of this issue\n nicpuppa: Hi everyone, as follow up I created 3 separate issues to reduce the scope and make easier to follow the progress:\r\n\r\n- [Verify correct behaviour of input mappings after bump to FEEL 1.17.3](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15445) -> this is a testing purpose issue, to verify that the new FEEL version has the correct behaviour\r\n- [Special characters in static inputs should not be escaped](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15447) -> as mentioned also by @saig0 in [this comment](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750#pullrequestreview-1731283017), characters in static input are still escaped. Static input are handled directly by Zeebe\r\n- [Verify unicode characters are not escaped in input mappings](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15446) -> after resolving the [feel issue related to unicode](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/issues/558), on Zeebe we should verify that the behaviour is as expected (unicode characters should not be escaped)\r\n\r\n~~In accordance with @abbasadel and @saig0 I will close this issue~~ This issue is still open only for tracking purpose, I mistakenly closed the issue\n abbasadel: Thanks, @nicpuppa, for the updates. \r\n\r\nI added the sub-issues into the main issue description for clarity and tracking purpose\n abbasadel: Hi everyone, \n- The [dynamic_input unnecessary escaping bug](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750) is currently resolved in [Zeebe 8.3.4 release](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/releases/tag/8.3.4)\n- The bug fix is https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15445 resolves the [connectors team bug](https://github.com/camunda/connectors/issues/239). Thanks @saig0 and @nicpuppa \n- The corrected behavior change is highlighted in the [release notes](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/releases/tag/8.3.4). Thanks @saig0 for the wording.\n- The support team is informed about the [corrected behavior change](https://camunda.slack.com/archives/CHAC0L80M/p1702029188512579)\n- Next action: Update [input mappings docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/variables/#input-mappings) as suggested by @akeller  ",

Have we found a more performant way to solve the problem? -->\r\n\r\nI noticed whilst putting together an example set of configuration for tenants that currently there is a exception when trying to assign members in configuration, which is:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: io.camunda.identity.entity.AccessRule.tenants: could not initialize proxy - no Session\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at it I can see that the code fails when we try to retrieve the tenants for the access rule that we want to assign a member to, frustratingly we have tests for this behaviour but it seems that the Hibernate session is extending to allow the tests to pass...\r\n\r\nHaving [read a little about the options to resolve this](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-initialize-proxy-exception) I decided to opt for the `JOIN FETCH` approach as mentioned [here](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-initialize-proxy-exception#4-using-join-fetching) because using `FetchType.EAGER` is generally discouraged.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\n- [x] Code changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Design review requested or not required\r\n\n\n Infra-connect: Successfully created backport PR for `v8.3`:\n- #2183",

It updates the `getForm` method in both `FormStoreElasticSearch.java` and `FormStoreOpenSearch.java` to handle different scenarios of form retrieval based on form id, process definition id, and version. It also adds new methods to check if a form is associated with a task or a process. Additionally, it includes updates to the unit tests and integration tests to cover these new scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Main Files Walkthrough\r\n\r\n- **[els-schema/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/store/elasticsearch/FormStoreElasticSearch.java]**: The `getForm` method is updated to handle different scenarios of form retrieval based on form id, process definition id, and version. New methods `getFormEmbedded`, `getLinkedForm`, `isFormAssociatedToTask`, and `isFormAssociatedToProcess` are added to support these scenarios.\r\n- **[els-schema/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/store/opensearch/FormStoreOpenSearch.java]**: Similar to `FormStoreElasticSearch.java`, the `getForm` method is updated and new methods are added to handle different scenarios of form retrieval.\r\n- **[webapp/src/test/java/io/camunda/tasklist/webapp/api/rest/v1/controllers/FormControllerTest.java]**: New test cases are added to cover the different scenarios of form retrieval. These include getting an embedded form, getting a linked form when version is passed, and getting a linked form when version is not passed.\r\n- **[webapp/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/webapp/api/rest/v1/controllers/FormController.java]**: The `getForm` method is updated to handle the optional `version` parameter. It also sets the `processDefinitionKey` when the form is deployed.\r\n- **[els-schema/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/schema/templates/TaskTemplate.java]**: The `FORM_ID` and `PROCESS_DEFINITION_ID` fields are added to support the new form retrieval scenarios.\r\n- **[els-schema/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/schema/indices/ProcessIndex.java]**: The `FORM_ID` and `ID` fields are added to support the new form retrieval scenarios.\r\n- **[els-schema/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/store/FormStore.java]**: The `getForm` method signature is updated to include the `version` parameter.\r\n- **[webapp/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/webapp/graphql/query/FormQueryResolver.java]**: The `getForm` method is updated to handle the optional `version` parameter.\r\n- **[els-schema/src/test/java/io/camunda/tasklist/store/elasticsearch/FormStoreElasticSearchTest.java]**: New test cases are added to cover the different scenarios of form retrieval in Elasticsearch.\r\n- **[els-schema/src/test/java/io/camunda/tasklist/store/opensearch/FormStoreOpenSearchTest.java]**: New test cases are added to cover the different scenarios of form retrieval in OpenSearch.\r\n\r\n## Definition of Done\r\n\r\n<!-- As author please check the items that apply before requesting a review. -->\r\n\r\n_Not all items need to be done depending on the issue and the pull request._\r\n\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria described in the issue are met\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Unit/integration tests are written, that verify all acceptance criteria of the issue\r\n- [ ] E2E tests are written, if the acceptance criteria can't be covered in unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] The fix/feature is tested manually by the author\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n\r\n- [ ] If documentation needs to be updated, an issue is created in the [camunda-platform-docs](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs) repo, and the issue is added to our Operate/Tasklist project board.\r\n\r\n## Definition of Reviewed\r\n\r\n<!-- As a reviewer please check the items that apply before approving this PR -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria described in the issue are met\r\n- [ ] Unit/integration tests are written, that verify all acceptance criteria of the issue\r\n- [ ] E2E tests are written, if the acceptance criteria can't be covered in unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] The fix/feature is tested manually by the reviewer\r\n\n\n github-actions[bot]: ## Test Results\n0 files   -   93  0 suites   - 93   0s [:stopwatch:](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action/blob/v2.10.0/README.md#the-symbols \"duration of all tests\") -
