    "gitHubText": "**Description**\r\n\r\n#6093 provides a backoff mechanism for the java client's job worker. When an error is received from the gateway by the job poller, the worker delays its next poll for available jobs. The go client should support the same functionality.\r\n\r\nThis functionality should be the same as the java client's. Including:\r\n- a default exponential backoff mechanism with the same defaults: {maxDelay:5s, minDelay:50ms, backoffFactor:1.6, jitterFactor:0.1}\r\n- the exponential backoff should be configurable\r\n- users should be able to provide their own implementation of a backoff strategy\r\n- backoff should only occur on errors received on the poll for available jobs\n\n Sijoma: Hey yall, I did a implementation for this for the go client. I'm a bit unsure in which cases the backoff should be applied though. \r\n\r\nIs it every time there is a ResourceExhausted? Or also when it fails to reopen the job polling stream? Is here: `clients/go/pkg/worker/jobPoller.go:95` the correct place?\r\n\r\n\n korthout: The backoff should be applied when the job poller fails to ask for jobs from the gateway. For example, in Java, [it backs off when any exception is thrown during the polling for jobs](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/069c17a74398d291b95d1c761357a457c62257ae/clients/java/src/main/java/io/zeebe/client/impl/worker/JobWorkerImpl.java#L136-L147). So that it actually controlled from the JobWorker, the poller is just used once in a while by the job worker.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen differently in the go client, but the details are a bit unclear to me. Somewhere [around here](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/clients/go/pkg/worker/jobPoller.go#L77-L114) would be my guess. \r\n\r\nI think that this part is the [main loop](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/clients/go/pkg/worker/jobPoller.go#L47-L71) for the poller. It seems to:\r\n- poll for jobs, and add them to the job queue\r\n- determine if it if needs to poll again\r\n\r\nSo, what is needed is some way to backoff from polling when an error occurs during polling. There are [other errors](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/grpc/#technical-error-handling) than `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` that could occur during polling.\n Sijoma: Thanks for the info @korthout, indeed it looks a bit differently in the go client. I will put in a draft-pr :). ",

We want to make this available using [custom interceptors](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/zeebe-gateway/interceptors/).\r\n\r\nAccording to [the decision made below](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14285#issuecomment-1851578839), the following tasks need to be completed:\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\n- [x] Expand the `InterceptorUtil` class to provide the `AUTHORIZED_TENANTS_KEY` gRPC context key.\r\n- [x] ~Extract the tenant-providing logic from the `IdentityInterceptor` into a new `IdentityTenantProvidingInterceptor`~\r\n\t1. ~This new interceptor is added only if `identity` is set as the `authentication.mode`, and `multiTenancy` is enabled (set to `true`).~\r\n\t2. Won't be done since the tenant-providing logic for Identity is closely tied to the Identity token, which is validated within the `IdentityInterceptor`. We would have to extract the token twice if we extract the tenant-providing logic.\r\n- [x] Handling `tenantId` data:\r\n\t1. Only use the data provided by the `AUTHORIZED_TENANTS_KEY` gRPC Context key if multi-tenancy is enabled.\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n\t1. Ensure that the existing tests that cover multi-tenancy over Identity pass\r\n\t2. Add IT tests to ensure that the Gateway uses the data provided by a custom tenant-providing interceptor when multi-tenancy is enabled.\r\n\t4. Add IT tests to ensure that the Gateway doesn't use the data provided by a custom tenant-providing interceptor when multi-tenancy is disabled.\r\n\t5. Add IT tests to ensure that a custom tenant-providing interceptor overrides the Identity tenant-providing interceptor when multi-tenancy is enabled.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/issues/3029:\r\n       - Extend the [Interceptor docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/zeebe-gateway/interceptors/) with a section on *Implementing a tenant-providing interceptor*\r\n       - Update the MultiTenancy docs for Zeebe to state that:\r\n                - Multi-tenancy in Zeebe is independent from Identity, if Zeebe is used as a standalone product\r\n                - If Zeebe is used as a standalone product, and multi-tenancy is enabled, users can implement a custom tenant-providing interceptor. A link to the Interceptor docs should be provided.\r\n        - If the full Camunda 8 stack is used, then a custom tenant-providing interceptor can't be used, and Identity must be configured since other Camunda 8 components must use Identity.\n\n koevskinikola: Solution proposals:\r\n1. Zeebe provides an `AbstractTenantProvidingInterceptor` class. \r\n    1. The class will implement the logic for adding the `tenantId` list to the gRPC context.\r\n    2. Users will need to extend this class and implement the tenant-providing logic.\r\n2. Zeebe provides a `TenantProvider` interface\r\n    1. Zeebe uses a `TenantProvidingInterceptor` class in the Zeebe Gateway module. Implementations of the  `TenantProvider` interface are passed to this interceptor.\r\n    2. Users will need to implement the `TenantProvider` interface\r\n3. Zeebe extends the `InterceptorUtil` class to provide the `AUTHORIZED_TENANTS_KEY`, and documents (in a similar manner to the `QueryApi`) how to use it with the gRPC Context.\r\n   1. Users may implement a \"tenant-providing\" interceptor as they see fit.\r\n   2. We document this in the Zeebe Interceptors documentation.\n koevskinikola: Decision:\r\nWe use solution proposal [3] from [the list above](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/14285#issuecomment-1847356998). Why:\r\n* PRO: It provides the most flexibility for users. Users can implement their tenant-providing logic in any of their gRPC interceptors.\r\n* PRO: It uses an existing Zeebe Interceptor mechanism (the `InterceptorUtil` class) to pass and extract data to/from interceptors.\r\n* CON: Users may still provide a `tenantId` list using this mechanism when multi-tenancy is disabled, as we have no mechanism to prevent this within an interceptor.\r\n   * However, we can control if the `tenantId` list is used or not inside the Gateway, depending if multi-tenancy is disabled or not.\r\n   * The alternative to avoid this CON is to use approach [1] or [2]. However, we would need to re-implement a mechanism for instantiating externally provided classes (we have this with the `IdentityRepository`. Furthermore, these approaches are less flexible, as we would require users to either extend an abstract class or implement an interface inside their code.",

Every element instance should contains its own type\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAlternative way to achieve the same goal is to look at export logs which takes more time and less accessible than Grafana.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt is more precise if we have activation, completion and termination information of catch events in the view.\r\n\n\n korthout: Marking this as `upcoming` as it can help us troubleshoot problems faster and more easily.\r\n\r\nIt is blocked by:\r\n- #13433 ",

This is because after restore, raft metastore is empty. So it restarts the term from 1. This is ok so far. But after Zeebe-2 becomes the leader and commits its InitialEntry at index `3983`, Zeebe-0 starts election probably because it did not receive any heartbeat from the leader `Zeebe-2`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO 2023-09-26T11:26:01.569385207Z [jsonPayload.context.partitionId: 26] [resource.labels.podName: zeebe-1] RaftServer{raft-partition-partition-26}{role=FOLLOWER} - Accepted PollRequest{term=1, candidate=0, lastLogIndex=3982, lastLogTerm=2}: candidate's log is up-to-date\r\nINFO 2023-09-26T11:26:01.577404370Z [jsonPayload.context.partitionId: 26] [resource.labels.podName: zeebe-1] RaftServer{raft-partition-partition-26}{role=FOLLOWER} - Accepted VoteRequest{term=2, candidate=0, lastLogIndex=3982, lastLogTerm=2}: candidate's log is up-to-date\r\nINFO 2023-09-26T11:26:01.582069421Z [jsonPayload.context.partitionId: 26] [resource.labels.podName: zeebe-1] RaftServer{raft-partition-partition-26} - Found leader 0\r\n```\r\nZeebe-1 accepts poll request from Zeebe-0 because Zeebe-0's lastLogTerm > Zeebe-1's current term 1. This leads to inconsistency. \r\n\r\n**Impact**\r\nIf it happens immediately after restore before writing any new data, it should be safe to restart the brokers. Due to the above error, the new leader Zeebe-0 cannot commit anything. So, as a result there won't be any actual data inconsistency. If we wait until all nodes are healthy before restarting the traffic to the cluster, this will not lead to any actual data inconsistency because no user requests has been processed yet. However, if there are new user data that has been processed, then there is a possibility for partial data loss. **Note that the data recovered from the backup won't be lost if this happens. Only new data will be affected.**\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFollowing scenario can lead to this error:\r\n1. A, B, C restored from the same backup, where the term of the last entry in the log is > 1\r\n2. A, B forms the quorum and A became the leader\r\n3. A and B committed new entries \r\n4. C does not know about the new leader. So it starts new election.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAfter, restoring from a backup raft can continue working in all scenarios.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n- Zeebe Version: Observed in 8.2.13\r\n\r\nRelates to [https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174)\r\n\n\n nicpuppa: This affect also a SM customer ([support case](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174)). In this case the problem was with `term`. Since it is reset, no new snapshots can be taken until the term increases to a higher value than the one before the backup. As a result, logs are not compacted and disk usage grows high.\r\n\r\nFixed by this [PR](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15272)",

This leads to a `NullPointerException` as the underlying builder doesnt support a null value. This is an issue as clients are able to set the `workerName` using the builder pattern after constructing the command.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic ActivateJobsCommandImpl(\r\n      final GatewayStub asyncStub,\r\n      final ZeebeClientConfiguration config,\r\n      final JsonMapper jsonMapper,\r\n      final Predicate<Throwable> retryPredicate) {\r\n    this.asyncStub = asyncStub;\r\n    this.jsonMapper = jsonMapper;\r\n    this.retryPredicate = retryPredicate;\r\n    builder = ActivateJobsRequest.newBuilder();\r\n    requestTimeout(config.getDefaultRequestTimeout());\r\n    timeout(config.getDefaultJobTimeout());\r\n    workerName(config.getDefaultJobWorkerName());\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nCreate an implementation of the `ZeebeClientProperties` that returns `null` for the `getDefaultJobWorkerName`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe builder should fallback to the default worker name only if it wasnt set by a client when constructing the final command.\r\n\r\n**Log/Stacktrace**\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: null\r\n\tat io.camunda.zeebe.gateway.protocol.GatewayOuterClass$ActivateJobsRequest$Builder.setWorker(GatewayOuterClass.java:2169)\r\n\tat io.camunda.zeebe.client.impl.command.ActivateJobsCommandImpl.workerName(ActivateJobsCommandImpl.java:83)\r\n\tat io.camunda.zeebe.client.impl.command.ActivateJobsCommandImpl.<init>(ActivateJobsCommandImpl.java:60)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n- Zeebe Version:8.3.0-alpha4\r\n\r\nLooks like it happens as the command builder is used instead of the previously used request builder since: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/commit/359a402b5bbee7247749385a458c5b3f3aba7e78\n\n korthout: @npepinpe This sounds like a regression introduced with #12888. Could you please have a look?\n npepinpe: We had a look together, and AFAIK this is the same behavior as ever. We were always calling `workerName` in the constructor of the command, and it makes sense to me to follow Simon's suggestion and only apply defaults in the build method, not in the constructor.\r\n\r\nEDIT: here's the commit which introduced setting the worker name as the default configuration: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/06f4e463efd3ca1be67056660f12abd4ad7867d8/clients/java/src/main/java/io/zeebe/client/impl/job/ActivateJobsCommandImpl.java#L46\r\n\r\nThat's from 2018, so it looks to me like this was always the behavior. The only thing I can imagine would be that _maybe_ the gRPC behavior changed, where they simply don't allow null values anymore, but I doubt it. I suspect if we check, it was always like this.\n npepinpe: > Looks like it happens as the command builder is used instead of the previously used request builder since: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/commit/359a402b5bbee7247749385a458c5b3f3aba7e78\r\n\r\n@sbuettner - can you point out to me where the change from request to command builder happened? From the commit, the code is the same - we extracted an interface out of a class, but the implementation was not changed.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the \"old\" implementation:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    final ActivateJobsCommandStep3 activateCommand =\r\n        jobClient\r\n            .newActivateJobsCommand()\r\n            .jobType(jobType)\r\n            .maxJobsToActivate(maxJobsToActivate)\r\n            .timeout(timeout)\r\n            .workerName(workerName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it was simply moved in the \"new\" one, but remains the same:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    final ActivateJobsCommandStep3 activateCommand =\r\n        jobClient\r\n            .newActivateJobsCommand()\r\n            .jobType(jobType)\r\n            .maxJobsToActivate(maxJobsToActivate)\r\n            .timeout(timeout)\r\n            .workerName(workerName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure what you mean by request vs command builder :thinking: \n sbuettner: @npepinpe It looks like it was changed here: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/commit/11c548dd4d46f62119a600da0dc1abad7231c417#diff-7101968ae21254c317a1606e4a1969ec3864b538403541ecc7161351b2bd38ddL86\n npepinpe: Good catch! Seems unrelated to job push, but it is indeed a regression in that sense for 8.3.0. I'll defer to the ZPA team on what the priority for it is.\n korthout: Thanks @npepinpe and @sbuettner for the extra input.\r\n\r\n- We'll need to fix this before 8.3 as it regressed recently.\r\n- We consider this mid severity, as a workaround is available (don't set null as the default job worker name)\r\n- We wonder how quickly a user would run into this, do you have to set `null` explicitly, or does it also occur when the client doesn't define any default?\r\n- This would change the impact dramatically, and so our priority\r\n- We want to timebox whether that is the case\r\n- It might be worth it to fix immediately then (but please timebox it)",

    "gitHubText": "If we allow the migration of process instances not entirely in a wait state, Zeebe would wrongly execute the process instance after the migration.\r\n\r\nIn short, unprocessed commands referring to the source process definition may exist on the log stream with a position higher than the process instance migration command. When we process these commands, the engine wrongly attempts to continue the processing on the source process definition as if the migration didn't occur. For a complete discussion, please read 'How should we deal with process instances in non-wait states?' in the epic's 'Discussions and Decisions' section. \r\n\r\nWe can either:\r\n1. Reject process instance migration if we know the process instance is not entirely in a wait state.\r\n2. Don't trust the process definition key in such commands, but rather look up the process definition from the state when processing commands.\r\n\r\nA downside to option 1 is: We don't know what commands exist on the log with a higher position than the command being processed. It may be that this solution is not water tight, requiring us to investigate option 2.\r\n\r\nA downside to option 2 is: Some commands may refer to elements that no longer exist in the target process. These will be rejected.\n\n korthout: Labeling this as a bug because it is if we don't resolve this.\n korthout: Estimated as medium, because it's not entirely clear how to resolve this yet. Estimate might be lower when this becomes clear.\n korthout: TL;DR: **I want to focus on option 2 for two reasons**:\r\n- **it should be a design requirement for any command processor in the first place**. By applying this requirement to all command processors, we simplify reasoning about the system and bring consistency to implementation. This requirement should be documented in our developer documentation.\r\n- **it is less restrictive than option 1**, allowing for migrations of process instances in active execution rather than only those in a complete wait state.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet's consider the different options.\r\n\r\n1. Reject process instance migration if we know the process instance is not entirely in a wait state.\r\n\r\nThis raises the question: Can we detect that the process instance is currently not entirely in a wait state? \r\n\r\nLet's start with regular process instance execution over sequence flows. Each flow scope element instance keeps track of the number of sequence flows that are currently taken inside it for which the target element has not yet been activated. So, we can use this. \r\n\r\nIf the sequence flow has not yet been taken, an element instance is always active (i.e. activating, activated, completing, or terminating). \r\n\r\nThis is the case irrespective of unprocessed `ProcessInstance` and `ProcessInstanceBatch` commands on the log.\r\n\r\nHowever, other unprocessed commands referring to the process definition on the log may continue the process execution. This means that option 1 is restrictive, and that option 1 is not water tight. This leads us to consider option 2: \r\n\r\n2. Don't trust the process definition key in such commands, but rather look up the process definition from the state when processing commands.\r\n\r\nOption 2 is actually a requirement for any command in our system because of the async nature of Zeebe's engine. Typically, the state is different when the command is appended to the log than when it is processed because other commands may been executed in between. Therefore, we can never trust all data in commands. This rule follows naturally from our stream processing design, and is why we've build things like [ProcessInstanceStateTransitionGuard](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/engine/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/engine/processing/bpmn/ProcessInstanceStateTransitionGuard.java).\r\n\r\nCommands that refer to data that may have changed due to migration are:\r\n- `Timer:TRIGGER` refers to `targetElementId` and `processDefinitionKey` \r\n- `ProcessMessageSubscription:CORRELATE` refers to `bpmnProcessId` and `elementId`\r\n- ~~`Signal:BROADCAST`~~ does not refer to properties that may have changed due to migration\r\n- `Incident:Resolve` refers to `bpmnProcessId`, `processDefinitionKey`, and `elementId`\r\n- `Job:*` (multiple intents) refers to `bpmnProcessId`, `processDefinitionVersion`, `processDefinitionKey`, and `elementId`\r\n- `UserTask:*` (multiple intents) refers to `bpmnProcessId`, `processDefinitionVersion`, `processDefinitionKey`, and `elementId`\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following commands also continue the process execution but could be covered by rejection of the command (option 1) if we follow that approach:\r\n- `ProcessInstance:*` (multiple intents) refers to `bpmnProcessId`, `elementId`, `version`, and `processDefinitionKey`\r\n- `ProcessInstanceBatch:*` (multiple intents)\r\n\r\nLastly, some commands don't directly continue the process execution but still refer to data that may have changed:\r\n- `MessageSubscription:*` (multiple intents) refers to `bpmnProcessId`\r\n\r\nSo, option\n korthout: The number of affected commands is strongly reduced for the first iteration due to the supported scope of instance migration MVP.\r\n\r\nHowever, in later iterations. These problems may surface when more is supported.\n korthout: Quick dump of my latest spike: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/compare/korthout-15129-unprocessed-commands-with-outdated-data-due-to-migration\n romansmirnov: @korthout and @saig0 ,\r\n\r\na potential option: Would it be possible to bookmark that a current \"active path\" (aka element instance or similar) has an outstanding follow-up command (to bring that in a valid - or wait - state)? While migrating an active path, the processor could check for this bookmark/flag being set or not. And if there is an outstanding command, it stops migrating, rolls back, and rejects the migration command.\r\n\r\nOr the instance itself could bookkeeping all outstanding commands? So they are all in one place stored, and once a command is being executed it is removed from that.\r\n\r\nDetails would need to be defined, but would this resolve the issue? If not, what is missing?\n korthout: @romansmirnov Sorry I did not find the time to answer anymore before my FTO. I believe @saig0 will consider your proposal.\r\n\r\n@saig0 If you manage to resolve this bug, please notify @berkaycanbc that we can remove the `@ExperimentalAPI` annotation from the java-client **and** the danger banner in the [concept docs](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs/pull/3000#issuecomment-1847526591)\n saig0: @romansmirnov I will follow your idea. :+1:  \r\n\r\nThe required data about the active \"outstanding\" command should be available already. I will check the data in the migration processor to reject the migration command.",

Could you share them in a comment?\n koevskinikola: Related to a [SUPPORT case](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19112) as well.\n koevskinikola: My hypothesis is that this is a time zone issue.\r\n\r\n1. We're using `Instance.now()` to set the `JWT#issuedAt` (`iat`) claim [here](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/6a730a7bf57f0491cb0b29e5b2c90533330b6c1b/auth/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/auth/impl/JwtAuthorizationEncoder.java#L66).\r\n2. The `Instance.now()` method provides an `Instant` from the system UTC clock.\r\n3. If the cluster is set on a different time zone, the JWT validation might throw an exception that `The Token can't be used before xxx`.\r\n\r\nI will try to confirm this with a test.\r\n\r\nProposed solutions:\r\n1. We use the `ActorClock` to set the time instead.\r\n2. We remove the `JWT.issuedAt` (`iat`) claim\r\n3. We remove the JWT validation when decoding the JWT token.\r\n\r\nDecision:\r\nWe will implement proposals 2 and 3 from above because:\r\n* We're only using the JWT token for data transport. The JWT token is not signed, and not used outside of Zeebe, so any data other than the authorization data isn't relevant. That means that the `issuedAt` claim can be removed.\r\n* Since the token isn't signed, validation isn't required. Coupled with the bad `issuedAt` implementation, it is causing bugs. It is better to disable the validation since existing Zeebe installations may already face the problem, and we want to disable the validation so that the issue doesn't pop up for existing JWT tokens.\r\n   * In that case, we will need to do our own validation that the `authorized_tenants` JWT claim is present. This can be done by doing a null-check when fetching the claim data since if the claim is not present, a `null` is returned.\r\n\r\ncc @korthout \r\n\n romansmirnov: @koevskinikola, just trying to understand the root cause of the issue, have you been able to validate your hypothesis? Isn't this \"just\" a clock syncing problem between the gateway node and broker node? By setting a leeway when verifying the token, would it help mitigate the issue?\r\n\r\nHowever, please consider this just a question to get a better understanding of the root cause. Meaning, I agree with the decision above to solve the problem anyway 😄 \n koevskinikola: Hey @romansmirnov ,\r\n\r\nI think you're right. It doesn't seem to be time-zone related, but just a matter of leeway.\r\n\r\nThat's because:\r\n1. The JWT library that we use (`java-jwt`) also uses `Instant.now()` inside the `Verifier` to get the current time to compare against.\r\n    * Since we're also using `Instant.now()` to set the `issuedAt` claim, this means the Verifier is always comparing UTC times.\r\n2. The `defaultLeeway` value in `java-jwt` is set to `0`. This means that verifying this token even half a second earlier will cause an issue (this seems to be the case in one of the occurences).\r\n\r\nSo we can definitely adjust the `leeway` to compensate. However, as I pointed out, we're not really signing the JWT token, so the `issuedAt` claim is irrelevant here.\r\n\r\nI would feel more confident in not verifying the `issuedAt` claim at all right now. If we ever decide to expose the JWT data to exported events, we can:\r\n1. Sign it first.\r\n2. Set and adjust the verification for the best-practice claims (like the `issuedAt`)\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI confirmed my hypothesis by:\r\n1. Providing a fixed clock with which I set the `issuedAt` claim on a JWT token.\r\n2. Create a JWT Verifier on which I set a fixed clock 1 second behing.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the JWT verification fails with the same message `The Token can't be used before...`/\n Zelldon: Happened in 8.4.0-alpha1 https://console.cloud.google.com/errors/detail/CI_Y0MHF3fmnggE;service=zeebe;time=P7D?project=zeebe-io but I suspect this fix was not part of the release.\n korthout: Nope 0d600f736e6c1c6cc69cda38d40c78dc4d5abfea is not part of `8.4.0-alpha1`.",

While processing these commands, the `ProcessMessageSubscriptionCorrelateProcessor` doesn't find a matching subscription and writes a `COMMAND_REJECTION` and a `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT` command. The `MessageSubscriptionRejectProcessor` _also_ rejects the `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT` command by writing a `COMMAND_REJECTION` because it does not find a matching correlation in the message state.\r\n\r\nThe `PROCESS_MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/CORRELATE` is rejected with cause `NOT_FOUND` and a matching message: \"Expected to correlate process message subscription with element key '22517998206768899' and message name 'MY_MESSAGE_NAME', but no such subscription was found\".\r\nThe `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT` is rejected with cause `INVALID_STATE` and message \"Expected message '112589990754201722' to be correlated for process with BPMN process id 'MY_PROCESS_ID' but no correlation was found\"\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\n\r\nOn one partition we have the subscription column family containing a subscription with `correlating=true` so the `PROCESS_MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/CORRELATE` is sent again and again. On the other partition, the subscription column family does not contain such an entry.\r\nHypothesis: A `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/CORRELATE` or  `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/DELETE`command was lost, leaking the subscription entry. `ProcessMessageSubscriptionCorrelateProcessor` handles non interrupting subscriptions by removing them from the state immediately and then sending `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/CORRELATE` just once. If that command is lost, nothing will resend it. The other partition keeps the partition in the state, tries to correlate again and again but only gets rejections because the receiving partition doesn't know about the subscription anymore.\r\n \r\n## Related Notes\r\n\r\n- It probably doesn't make sense to reject a `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT` command, can't we just clean up the subscription when the receiving partition rejected it?\r\n- Why write `COMMAND_REJECTION`s for internal commands not sent by a user anyway? Especially since the rejection is already described with a `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT` command.\r\n- To fully fix this, we need to find a way to recover from this broken state, not just prevent it from happening again.\r\n\r\nrelates to https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19189\n\n oleschoenburg: Actually a duplicate of https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/5750 (thanks to @saig0 for finding it!) but let's keep this one open because it contains some more information on how a partition can get into this state\n remcowesterhoud: ZPA Triage:\r\n- As there is already a PR open for this I've put it in our iteration and in review so it's visible.\r\n- The PR is in draft, I've asked @oleschoenburg for clarification on the status of the PR.",

If a broker is leader for more than 1 partition, iterating through the tenants in the `JobActivationPropertiesImpl` will fail, as the ArrayProperty is not thread-safe.\r\n\r\n**Quick-fix**\r\nWe can clone [the job activation properties in the `BpmnJobActivationBehavior`](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/engine/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/engine/processing/bpmn/behavior/BpmnJobActivationBehavior.java#L67-L70), before we get the list of tenants. Because we have a copy we'll no longer have multiple partitions iterating over the same `ArrayProperty`.\r\n\r\n**Nicer fix**\r\nThe engine always assumes everything is single-threaded. This makes it very easy to make changes in the engine. The job streamer is now the exception. If the broker can register streams per partition, instead of reusing the streamer we'll no longer have multiple partitions interacting with the same instance. This resolves the problem.\n npepinpe: Isn't the real issue that iterating over a supposedly immutable `ArrayProperty` actually mutates the object? :sweat_smile: The stream registry expects all its information to be immutable, so when `JobActivationPropertiesImpl` is, in fact, mutable, it's what causes the design dissonance.\r\n\r\nI think almost all of us got bitten by the fact that iterating over an `ArrayValue` mutates the underlying object, which is (much like the Spanish inquisition) never what you expect. You can see so many of these objects where we clone the array property to a list or something before iterating for this specific reason. For example, `JobBatchRecord#getJobKeys`.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I wouldn't propose registering streams per partition - it's just redundant work. Instead, you can wrap the given `JobStreamer` in a partition aware facade which can copy info when you need it.\n npepinpe: This came up in our planning - should I work on this? Will you work on this? If so, should I assume that, since it's in `ready`, it will be in the next 2 weeks?\n remcowesterhoud: Sorry, I put it in ready because we thought it was a critical issue and release blocker. We may have time for the quick-fix this week, but we have to prioritise documentation for the release. We want this to be part of 8.3.1 release.\r\n\r\nWe haven't decided yet on which approach we should take. If we have a separate job streamer for each partition I'd say it falls under ZDP responsibility. The quick-fix we can definitely do ourselves. Iterating over the ArrayProperty without mutating it sounds great too and would also be our responsibility.\n Zelldon: [Run into this issue as well when using cloud benchmark with SaaS cluster with v8.3.0](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=resource.type%3D%22k8s_container%22%0Aresource.labels.project_id%3D%22camunda-saas-prod%22%0Aresource.labels.location%3D%22northamerica-northeast2%22%0Aresource.labels.cluster_name%3D%22worker-5%22%0Aresource.labels.namespace_name%3D%222b3d50c8-e590-4eba-97d4-1da76e0d8fb4-zeebe%22%0Aresource.labels.pod_name:%22zeebe-%22%0A-resource.labels.container_name%3D%22zeebe-analytics%22;pinnedLogId=2023-10-10T14:22:20.739210406Z%2Fbvjumarl3k64dbew;cursorTimestamp=2023-10-10T14:22:28.849604018Z;startTime=2023-10-10T13:24:40.544024Z;endTime=2023-10-10T15:24:40.544Z?project=camunda-saas-prod)\r\n\r\njust want to highlight that this makes job push right now totally unusable.\n megglos: > We haven't decided yet on which approach we should take.

It can run concurrently to the stream processor, where the two access a shared in-memory state (aka transient state). Access to this state is threadsafe, but not spread over multiple calls.\r\n\r\nThe race condition appears to exist here: The entries are first retrieved from the transient state, before we `get` the subscription from the persisted state. The transient state may have been modified before, leading to both states not being in-sync.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/d928ba2ed6321b3e613320e9c7fcdd0bc0decc44/engine/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/engine/state/message/DbMessageSubscriptionState.java#L229-L236\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\nIf possible add a minimal reproducer code sample\r\n- when using the Java client: https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-test-template-java\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis may be hard to reproduce, as it's a race condition.

It's a rare occurrence.\r\n- Lastly, users that do run into this too often can disable the checker from running concurrently to stream processor by setting `zeebe.broker.processing.enableAsyncScheduledTasks: false`. This will completely mitigate this issue.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, this issue is high severity as it disrupts regular processing, causing a drop in availability.\n korthout: It's possible that this is similar to this issue for timers:\r\n- https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13598\n berkaycanbc: @korthout do you think we can move this one to ready so that it can be picked up? I can take a look at it.\n berkaycanbc: We can add a null check and log that subscription removed from the state if it is not found. Since message subscription record either correlated or deleted from the state, it should be safe to skip that record. WDYT? @korthout \n korthout: @berkaycanbc Sounds like a good plan. Feel free to pick it up. 👍  Please make sure to verify whether this race condition exists on previous versions (i.e. 8.2)",

Based on the previous comment we check the Migration code, etc. Based on the code we would expect that the migration is not executed if there is still an job existing, but where not sure about the second condition https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/1c6c3cc2ec75bdb298c1e644131a586edbf0f501/engine/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/engine/state/instance/DbJobState.java#L246\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wrote an Engine test, with snapshot and replay. Here everything worked fine. This means without migration there is no issue.\r\n\r\nLater we came up with an integration test which involves restarting the node and transitioning (this will cause migration to run).\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void test() {\r\n    // given\r\n    final String jobType = \"test\";\r\n    clientRule.createSingleJob(jobType);\r\n\r\n    final var activateResponse =\r\n        clientRule\r\n            .getClient()\r\n            .newActivateJobsCommand()\r\n            .jobType(jobType)\r\n            .maxJobsToActivate(1)\r\n            .send()\r\n            .join();\r\n    final var jobKey = activateResponse.getJobs().get(0).getKey();\r\n\r\n    final Duration backoffTimeout = Duration.ofDays(30);\r\n    clientRule\r\n        .getClient()\r\n        .newFailCommand(jobKey)\r\n        .retries(1)\r\n        .retryBackoff(backoffTimeout)\r\n        .send()\r\n        .join();\r\n\r\n    // when\r\n    clusteringRule.triggerAndWaitForSnapshots();\r\n    clusteringRule.restartBroker(clusteringRule.getLeaderForPartition(1).getNodeId());\r\n    clusteringRule.getClock().addTime(backoffTimeout.plus(backoffTimeout));\r\n\r\n    // then\r\n    Awaitility.await()\r\n        .until(\r\n            () ->\r\n                clientRule\r\n                    .getClient()\r\n                    .newActivateJobsCommand()\r\n                    .jobType(jobType)\r\n                    .maxJobsToActivate(1)\r\n                    .send()\r\n                    .join(),\r\n            r -> !activateResponse.getJobs().isEmpty());\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt turns out that this test fails.

This helps offload time-consuming work that could otherwise block the actual workflow processing. \r\n\r\nFor example, job deadlines are checked for expiration by the `JobTimeoutTrigger`, which will append commands for each job to time them out. The stream processor will then process this command asynchronously. Eventually, the job changes state to `TIMED_OUT` when the command is processed. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the `JobTimeoutTrigger` continues to check for expired job deadlines periodically. If the stream processor is blocked, it may happen that the `JobTimeoutTrigger` continues to append the same `Job:TIME_OUT` command. There is nothing that stops it from overloading the stream processor.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many of the scheduled tasks suffer from a similar problem.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\n\r\nScheduled tasks need to keep a cache of recently appended commands (or something similar) that can be used to avoid appending the same command multiple times.\r\n\r\nThis should be available in a generic way, so all scheduled tasks can easily add support for this.\r\n\r\n**Incident**\r\n\r\nFollow up issue from incident: [INC-274: Streamprocessor lagging behind](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8CPBThWtPUxEpmwcoxeb_9pn1eRB2CPpHPiwEVoa3Q/edit#heading=h.hyf892uforsw)\r\n\r\nSupport: \r\n- https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-18291\r\n- https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-18997 \r\n\n\n korthout: Marking this as high impact, as it is a recurring pain. Resolving this would lower the load on clusters experiencing problems where timers, buffered messages, or job timeouts play a role. This would help in the investigation as well as ease recovery.\n abbasadel: I'm increasing the priority of this issue/feature to 'upcoming' since there is a support case waiting for it. \r\nStill, it is highly unlikely to be able to work on this before 8.4. However, we will update the issue once we plan to work on it.\n megglos: ZDP-Planning:\r\n- pushing into the inbox of ZPA to get an update on this as it relates to #14003\n korthout: The ZPA-team discussed this issue again and now considers this a bug. Originally, I felt it was a feature, as we have never supported many timers triggering at once (i.e., there's always a limit somewhere). However, the team feels that outages should not occur from existing features, irrespective of how they are used. Add to this that we don't have documentation about some artibrary limit to the number of timers. Lastly, users feel that this is a bug, and so should we.\r\n\r\nAs a bug, it may be easier to prioritize and release a fix for this as we can backport and patch previous versions.\n dddpaul: @korthout Hi!\r\n\r\nIs there any updates for this bug? I would be nice to have a due date )\n korthout: Hi @dddpaul, the team plans to spend time on this in our current iteration. There's a chance that we can fit a solution in the upcoming patch releases, but we cannot promise this.\n\nWe'll need to consider different solutions. For example, the proposed cache reduces the load on the system in most cases but will not remove the problem completely. Alternatively, ideas like #12560 could help but come with other downsides. The developer(s) working on this issue should consider whether caching is enough or whether another solution might be more fitting. As this is not yet clear, it's possible that a solution will not be ready before the upcoming patch releases. However, we plan to spend time on this issue now.\n Zelldon: There was an L1 blocker again because of this https://jira.camunda.com/plugins/servlet/mobile#issue/SUPPORT-18997 \n\nHandled by @npepinpe \n npepinpe: Users are heavily impacted by this, so I would like to bump this to critical, with a focus on fixing timers. Timers are different from message correlation has they don't involve inter-partition communication, which may help narrow the scope of the fix for now (i.e. writes are guaranteed to succeed).\r\n\r\nThat said, I noticed some possible concurrency issues with the `DueDateTimerChecker`, which could lead to more timers than required being scheduled under high load.\r\n\r\nIf enabled, the `DueDateTimerChecker` runs in the asynchronous scheduler actor, separately from the stream processor.\r\n\r\nHowever, both actors will access the `DueDateTimerChecker`:\r\n\r\n`DueDateTimerChecker#scheduleTimer` is called from the engine/side-effects, i.e. processing actor. It then:\r\n\r\n- Accesses the following state: `shouldRescheduleChecker`, `checkerRunning`, `nextDueDate` (rw)\r\n- Checks if the checker is currently running. This is a non-volatile boolean check.\r\n- If it's not running, it schedules a task.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, scheduling is done on the async scheduler actor. This is the `TriggerEntitiesTask`. It:\r\n\r\n- Accesses the following state: `shouldRescheduleChecker`, `checkerRunning` (rw), `nextDueDate` (rw)\r\n\r\nIs this correct? If so we have non-volatile state being accessed by two different actors, and possibly some race conditions on when and if to schedule the next timer.\r\n\r\nMoving on the the possible solution. In order to keep it light of course, we'd need to to have a way to identify a timer trigger uniquely. Since every time instance can only be scheduled for trigger once in the state, it should be enough to distinguish them with the timer key, which is a single long. \r\n\r\nThe general idea, then, is to cache locally in the `DueDateTimerChecker` state (or some state) which commands have been written, so as to avoid writing them again. A perfect cache would be unbounded - you'd have to possibly store as many timers in there as could possibly exist (worst case scenario).  But a lossy cache is probably acceptable. Take `LongHashSet` from Agrona - an empty, pre-initialized set instance of 1 million keys takes 8MB of memory. Filled, it takes about twice, ~16MB. It's a bit hard to add LRU behavior to such a set however. Eviction could be random to keep things simple/fast, or we can use a `SortedSet`. However, a `TreeSet` takes about ~60MB for 1 million longs, so it's already substantially heavier - but it's pretty easy/fast to add LRU eviction to it. So on the off chance the key was evicted _before_ it was removed explicitly from the cache, you'd potentially still write a second trigger command. But the bigger the cache, the less likely this is to happen.\r\n\r\nI sync'd with @Zelldon today about this, and we decided to move forward with the local cache, only for checkers which perform no inter-partition communication.\r\n\r\nFor timers, we'll use the timer key as the unique cache ID. When iterating of timers, if the timer key is in the cache, then we skip it. Once the task result is built, we can populate the cache with all the timer keys we will be writing. Since the scheduler (even async) is sequenced, we're guaranteed that this write will succeed, or the whole thing will fail (and the cache would be \"restarted\"). We won't be touching things like leader election and so on. On recovery, it's still possible that the same timers would be triggered twice, but the overload load will be greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThis solution is likely adaptable to other checkers which run locally, such as job timeout and message expiry. For messages we can easily use the key. For jobs, we can't use the job key, since you can have multiple activations/time outs. We could use the job key if we can guarantee that the cache is properly cleaned up whenever the job is activated.\r\n\r\nAnyway, long winded comment to say we'll get started on a bounded lossy cache-based prototype.\r\n\r\n\n npepinpe: So in the end, we'll build the cache on the stream processor side. I describe the approach we ended up with in the description of this PR: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15073\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions. For now it's entirely on the stream platform/ZDP side, but it's still useful to know how it works. Plus, if you want to cache future scheduled commands in the future, you'll need to know where to add them :upside_down_face: \n npepinpe: See some benchmark results courtesy of @Zelldon - https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15073#issuecomment-1803887603 :tada: \n korthout: We took it off the ZPA board, as ZDP has found a solution on their side 🙇  Thanks again @Zelldon and @npepinpe \n dddpaul: Hi!\r\n\r\nThis looks like a wonderful job.  But this new timer cache doesn't solve my problem with bunch of UNIQUE timers from DIFFERENT process instances. I've illustrated my problem here https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/5134#issuecomment-1752006281. My comment was stated as duplicate of this issue which was likely fixed with timer cache solution in PR #15136 (for 8.3).\r\n\r\nI could not understand how this cache solution will help me but had some hope and belief. Well, there no miracle happened.\r\nI've just tested on 8.3-stable\r\n![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/628226/19ab7e3f-7708-465b-8bce-215e55fd6278)\r\n\r\nThousands or millions of unique timer events still overload brokers:\r\n![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/628226/97951508-56da-4723-8910-3ee8149461eb)\r\n\r\nThis is my process with timer:\r\n![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/628226/471fd3e9-c5c5-4c0b-b4c8-e0a9263259b7)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n npepinpe: We're working on another solution for that in parallel. https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/10087\n\nI know the issue specifies IPC, but the proposed solution will enforce rate limits between the different categories, user submitted commands, internal/scheduled commands, and remote ones.",

Escaping happening in the first place is fine I believe as this is a JSON string and `\\\\n` is the standard way to encode newlines there.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n* Deploy + run [test process](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/files/9159826/input-test.bpmn.txt)\n* See double escaping happening in string inputs\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nWe do the unescaping magic ourselves so that in user land no one needs to worry:\n\n  * I define an input mapping `foo = \"a\\nb\"`\n  * In my job worker I see `foo = \"a\\nb\"`\n\nAs a more user un-friendly alternative we could consider: String inputs are escaped like expression inputs (no double escaping), we clearly document how escaped strings shall be worked with (and how un-escaping has to be done in user land).

Or do we regard this as a nasty-bug-turned-public-api?\n menski: @felix-mueller this is something which mostly effects connectors but it is very unexpected behavior. We would like to understand if you have any input on priority for this.\n felix-mueller: It should be fixed at some point. Since we still need to root-cause and better understand the issue it is probably not S. We won't priotize it for the next few iterations (first we need to finish instance modification, DMN evaluation and delete definitions).\n menski: Thanks Felix, I put the priority on \"Later\" for now\n darox: I don't know whether I'm hitting the same issue. I'm using the Go client to ingest JSON formatted data into Zeebe. Jobs are failing due to escaped double quotes. If I set vars manually via simple-monitor everything works as expected. \n igpetrov: Hi team, is there any ETA to fix this? It is affecting currently 3 connectors.\n felix-mueller: @igpetrov currently we have planned to look into it after instance modification, DMN evaluation and Delete Definitions. these topics are scheduled to be included in our April minor release, so if we don't change priorities we probably will look at it in a few months.\r\n\r\nfrom connectors perspective can we live with this for a few months?\n igpetrov: Hi @felix-mueller, appreciate your update. Absolutely. Just wanted to understand the ETA. Thank you!\n tmetzke: For reference, in Connectors, we currently do the following to work around this with data we receive as variables after Zeebe has processed the user input:\r\n```\r\nStringEscapeUtils.unescapeJson(jsonStringVariable)\r\n```\r\nThis uses `StringEscapeUtils` from `org.apache.commons:commons-text`.\n nikku: @felix-mueller The longer we keep such behavior in the core, the harder it will be for people to unbuild their hacks (trying to work with zeebe data). My :two: :coin:.\n nikku: A similar issue is reported by a customer through [SUPPORT-15887](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-15887). \n nikku: I've updated the issue with a clear expected behavior, reflecting https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-15887, but also https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/9859#issuecomment-1318121197 have reported.\n menski: Discussed in the planning meeting on 2023-02-17. Right now we don't have capacity to work on this, and deprioritize it as the customer has a workaround available.\n korthout: When we work on this, we need to make sure not to break user space when backporting it to patches. We can do this by adding a configuration setting that allows switching between the current (broken) and new (fixed) behaviors. The default should stay the same in patch releases, but in a minor release we can change the default. This should be clearly communicated in the release notes (and blog) so users understand the change.\n abbasadel: This issue was mentioned again in [SUPPORT-17621](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-17621) and blocking connectors team's [here](https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle/issues/239)\n korthout: When we resolve this issue, please verify whether the fix also resolves:\r\n- https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13551\n Benjoyo: Also came across this, the `StringEscapeUtils.unescapeJson` workaround works for now but would be nice to have this fixed soon :)\n mschoe: I run into this issue when using the GH outbound connector and create a new issue with a multi line description field.  As this is a quite common use case I'm wondering when we are planning to provide a fix. @felix-mueller is this still scheduled for the 8.5 release in April 2024? \n christian-konrad: Would https://github.com/camunda/product-hub/issues/1040 help here or is it just a quick fix on string behavior?\n saig0: @nicpuppa started to work on this issue by fixing the escaping in the FEEL engine [here](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750). We plan to deliver a fix in one of the next patch releases. :rocket: \r\n\r\n@christian-konrad the FEEL templating is a bigger topic. Let's fix the issue with the escaping first. :+1: \n christian-konrad: Perfect @saig0 ! Thanks\n MaxTru: Hi @abbasadel ,\r\n\r\naccording to the [previous assessment](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/9859#issuecomment-1805096523) this should have been fixed with this [version bump](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/commit/4a90c77137dcad51106ee1e2fa8d1172c12640c2). Can you verify from Zeebe perspective please and update this issue? Thanks\n megglos: We need to clarify whether this change is breaking, especially in regards to present workaround in other components such as https://github.com/camunda/connector-slack/issues/48 &\r\nhttps://github.com/camunda/connector-google-drive/issues/20\r\nWhile for the REST connector no workaround seems to be in place and there a patch by zeebe would resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nIf it's breaking we may prefer to only release it in the next minor or at least coordinate with the affected components to remove the workaround applied for a patch. But then we have the risk that we have a dependency between patch levels of connectors and zeebe.\r\n\r\n@abbasadel will sync with @saig0 on this tomorrow and ping back.\n abbasadel: Hi everyone, this is Zeebe's assessment: \r\n- The recent [bug fix](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750) on the FEEL engine is not backward compatible from Zeebe's point of view. However, we believe, based on @saig0’s feedback and our tests, the impact on our users is low since the recommended workaround we provided was to use [unescapeJson API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringEscapeUtils.html#unescapeJson-java.lang.String-) from Apache Commons which handles breaking change.\r\n- As the previous behavior was wrong, mentioning the new behavior change in the release notes and as an announcement would be needed\r\n- This FEEL fix should resolve [bug](https://github.com/camunda/connectors/issues/239), to be validated by Connectors/Operate teams. \r\n- The support team should also be aware of this FEEL behavior change once release\r\n\r\n\r\n\n MaxTru: > Hi everyone, this is Zeebe's assessment:\r\n> \r\n> * The recent [bug fix](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750) on the FEEL engine is not backward compatible from Zeebe's point of view.

Will you and the ZPA team please ensure that all these things happen? If so, can we please track this via a breakdown and DRI assignments? Why is the issue not in `in progress` and has no assignee?\n abbasadel: @MaxTru, we will take care of this issue\n nicpuppa: Hi everyone, as follow up I created 3 separate issues to reduce the scope and make easier to follow the progress:\r\n\r\n- [Verify correct behaviour of input mappings after bump to FEEL 1.17.3](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15445) -> this is a testing purpose issue, to verify that the new FEEL version has the correct behaviour\r\n- [Special characters in static inputs should not be escaped](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15447) -> as mentioned also by @saig0 in [this comment](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750#pullrequestreview-1731283017), characters in static input are still escaped. Static input are handled directly by Zeebe\r\n- [Verify unicode characters are not escaped in input mappings](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15446) -> after resolving the [feel issue related to unicode](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/issues/558), on Zeebe we should verify that the behaviour is as expected (unicode characters should not be escaped)\r\n\r\n~~In accordance with @abbasadel and @saig0 I will close this issue~~ This issue is still open only for tracking purpose, I mistakenly closed the issue\n abbasadel: Thanks, @nicpuppa, for the updates. \r\n\r\nI added the sub-issues into the main issue description for clarity and tracking purpose\n abbasadel: Hi everyone, \n- The [dynamic_input unnecessary escaping bug](https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/pull/750) is currently resolved in [Zeebe 8.3.4 release](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/releases/tag/8.3.4)\n- The bug fix is https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15445 resolves the [connectors team bug](https://github.com/camunda/connectors/issues/239). Thanks @saig0 and @nicpuppa \n- The corrected behavior change is highlighted in the [release notes](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/releases/tag/8.3.4). Thanks @saig0 for the wording.\n- The support team is informed about the [corrected behavior change](https://camunda.slack.com/archives/CHAC0L80M/p1702029188512579)\n- Next action: Update [input mappings docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/concepts/variables/#input-mappings) as suggested by @akeller  ",

    "gitHubText": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR downgrades job worker back pressure, which is observed as job yielding on the broker side, from an error state to an expected state. This means downgrading logs to trace level in most cases, and instead relying on metrics to track if we're blocked too often. Trace logging can then be turned on on-demand to narrow down issues.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I took the opportunity to refactor the gateway push-to-client logic out of the `AggregatedClientStream` and `ClientStreamImpl` classes into its own class, `ClientStreamPusher`. These classes are now just data classes.\r\n\r\nWhen back pressure occurs, the previous state was the following:\r\n\r\n| Node type | Image |\r\n| --------- | ----- |\r\n| Gateway | ![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/43373/42e45e95-6450-430d-b800-eacac299995a) |\r\n| Broker | ![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/43373/3d62181b-fd04-4d93-afcc-a2b6c6bcb2a5) |\r\n\r\nIt now looks like this without trace logging:\r\n\r\n| Node type | Image |\r\n| --------- | ----- |\r\n| Gateway | ![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/43373/4049f382-a009-41b1-afb9-fc99bbda5d2e) |\r\n| Broker | ![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/43373/73d80908-7826-4667-a428-7a27ddc375ba) |\r\n\r\nAnd with trace logging enabled:\r\n\r\n| Node type | Image |\r\n| --------- | ----- |\r\n| Gateway | ![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/43373/624712f3-21f7-4ac0-bbc9-621b758d9084) |\r\n| Broker | ![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/43373/6318956f-7eb0-4f7c-9910-b0960a6155bb) |\r\n\r\n> [!Note]\r\n> I did not throttle the trace logging. My reasoning is if you're tracing something, you actually want to see everything, not just some of it.\r\n\r\nAnd a quick preview of the new metric visualization:\r\n\r\n> [!Note] \r\n> I will add the new metric visualization in a separate PR since Grafana changes tend to be quite big and difficult to review.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/43373/c0289c06-0527-4cc5-b0c3-50c649d6d194)\r\n\r\nAnd here we can see when only one worker is slower than the others in the same deployment:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/43373/7228acab-3682-495d-ab76-7edcefa79899)\r\n\r\nSo we see that one gateway reports some blocked errors, but the other push metrics are \"successful\". This could help diagnose issues with specific stream, as you can then look at that gateway's actuator/trace logs to narrow things down.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\ncloses #15455\r\n\r\n<!-- Cut-off marker\r\n_All lines under and including the cut-off marker will be removed from the merge commit message_\r\n\r\n## Definition of Ready\r\n\r\nPlease check the items that apply, before requesting a review.\r\n\r\nYou can find more details about these items in our wiki page about [Pull Requests and Code Reviews](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/wiki/Pull-Requests-and-Code-Reviews).\r\n\r\n* [ ] I've reviewed my own code\r\n* [ ] I've written a clear changelist description\r\n* [ ] I've narrowly scoped my changes\r\n* [ ] I've separated structural from behavioural changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Definition of Done\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the items that apply, before merging or (if possible) before requesting a review. -->\r\n\r\n_Not all items need to be done depending on the issue and the pull request._\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n* [ ] The changes are backwards compatibility with previous versions\r\n* [ ] If it fixes a bug then PRs are created to [backport](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/compare/stable/0.24...main?expand=1&template=backport_template.md&title=[Backport%200.24]) the fix to the last two minor versions.

Have we found a more performant way to solve the problem? -->\r\n\r\nAs described in the linked issue, there appears to be a clashing of dependency versions for the jupiter artifacts, setting the versions via a `dependencyManagement` block doesn't seem to be successful (more exploration could be good here), so I have opted for a two fold approach:\r\n\r\n1. Set the Jupiter versions to a version that works\r\n2. Configure the maven failsafe plugin to fail the build if no tests are run during the verify stage for the management-api artifact.\r\n\r\nThe first point is clear, the second point is an extra layer of protection, we know that there are ITs that run during the validation phase in the `management-api` module so seeing no tests run is not expected (unless the tests are skipped using `-DskipTests=true` though the build is still successful in this instance.\r\n\r\n### Is there anything else to consider?\r\n<!-- As a suggestion, were any alternatives considered? Is there any particular decision you'd like to highlight? -->\r\n\r\nI tried to think of different ways to work through the dependency clashes but they felt at best like I was sticking a plaster over things and not letting Maven use its built in logic for dependency resolution (by for example excluding the dependency from spring-boot-test` or forcing the version).\r\n\r\nI believe that for now (and to get our builds back to a credible position) this change is sufficient. \r\n\n",

    "gitHubText": "**Description**\r\n\r\n#6093 provides a backoff mechanism for the java client's job worker. When an error is received from the gateway by the job poller, the worker delays its next poll for available jobs. The go client should support the same functionality.\r\n\r\nThis functionality should be the same as the java client's. Including:\r\n- a default exponential backoff mechanism with the same defaults: {maxDelay:5s, minDelay:50ms, backoffFactor:1.6, jitterFactor:0.1}\r\n- the exponential backoff should be configurable\r\n- users should be able to provide their own implementation of a backoff strategy\r\n- backoff should only occur on errors received on the poll for available jobs\n\n Sijoma: Hey yall, I did a implementation for this for the go client. I'm a bit unsure in which cases the backoff should be applied though. \r\n\r\nIs it every time there is a ResourceExhausted? Or also when it fails to reopen the job polling stream? Is here: `clients/go/pkg/worker/jobPoller.go:95` the correct place?\r\n\r\n\n korthout: The backoff should be applied when the job poller fails to ask for jobs from the gateway. For example, in Java, [it backs off when any exception is thrown during the polling for jobs](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/069c17a74398d291b95d1c761357a457c62257ae/clients/java/src/main/java/io/zeebe/client/impl/worker/JobWorkerImpl.java#L136-L147). So that it actually controlled from the JobWorker, the poller is just used once in a while by the job worker.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen differently in the go client, but the details are a bit unclear to me. Somewhere [around here](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/clients/go/pkg/worker/jobPoller.go#L77-L114) would be my guess. \r\n\r\nI think that this part is the [main loop](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/clients/go/pkg/worker/jobPoller.go#L47-L71) for the poller. It seems to:\r\n- poll for jobs, and add them to the job queue\r\n- determine if it if needs to poll again\r\n\r\nSo, what is needed is some way to backoff from polling when an error occurs during polling. There are [other errors](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/grpc/#technical-error-handling) than `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` that could occur during polling.\n Sijoma: Thanks for the info @korthout, indeed it looks a bit differently in the go client. I will put in a draft-pr :). ",

This is because after restore, raft metastore is empty. So it restarts the term from 1. This is ok so far. But after Zeebe-2 becomes the leader and commits its InitialEntry at index `3983`, Zeebe-0 starts election probably because it did not receive any heartbeat from the leader `Zeebe-2`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO 2023-09-26T11:26:01.569385207Z [jsonPayload.context.partitionId: 26] [resource.labels.podName: zeebe-1] RaftServer{raft-partition-partition-26}{role=FOLLOWER} - Accepted PollRequest{term=1, candidate=0, lastLogIndex=3982, lastLogTerm=2}: candidate's log is up-to-date\r\nINFO 2023-09-26T11:26:01.577404370Z [jsonPayload.context.partitionId: 26] [resource.labels.podName: zeebe-1] RaftServer{raft-partition-partition-26}{role=FOLLOWER} - Accepted VoteRequest{term=2, candidate=0, lastLogIndex=3982, lastLogTerm=2}: candidate's log is up-to-date\r\nINFO 2023-09-26T11:26:01.582069421Z [jsonPayload.context.partitionId: 26] [resource.labels.podName: zeebe-1] RaftServer{raft-partition-partition-26} - Found leader 0\r\n```\r\nZeebe-1 accepts poll request from Zeebe-0 because Zeebe-0's lastLogTerm > Zeebe-1's current term 1. This leads to inconsistency. \r\n\r\n**Impact**\r\nIf it happens immediately after restore before writing any new data, it should be safe to restart the brokers. Due to the above error, the new leader Zeebe-0 cannot commit anything. So, as a result there won't be any actual data inconsistency. If we wait until all nodes are healthy before restarting the traffic to the cluster, this will not lead to any actual data inconsistency because no user requests has been processed yet. However, if there are new user data that has been processed, then there is a possibility for partial data loss. **Note that the data recovered from the backup won't be lost if this happens. Only new data will be affected.**\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFollowing scenario can lead to this error:\r\n1. A, B, C restored from the same backup, where the term of the last entry in the log is > 1\r\n2. A, B forms the quorum and A became the leader\r\n3. A and B committed new entries \r\n4. C does not know about the new leader. So it starts new election.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAfter, restoring from a backup raft can continue working in all scenarios.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n- Zeebe Version: Observed in 8.2.13\r\n\r\nRelates to [https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174)\r\n\n\n nicpuppa: This affect also a SM customer ([support case](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174)). In this case the problem was with `term`. Since it is reset, no new snapshots can be taken until the term increases to a higher value than the one before the backup. As a result, logs are not compacted and disk usage grows high.\r\n\r\nFixed by this [PR](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15272)",

Could you share them in a comment?\n koevskinikola: Related to a [SUPPORT case](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19112) as well.\n koevskinikola: My hypothesis is that this is a time zone issue.\r\n\r\n1. We're using `Instance.now()` to set the `JWT#issuedAt` (`iat`) claim [here](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/6a730a7bf57f0491cb0b29e5b2c90533330b6c1b/auth/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/auth/impl/JwtAuthorizationEncoder.java#L66).\r\n2. The `Instance.now()` method provides an `Instant` from the system UTC clock.\r\n3. If the cluster is set on a different time zone, the JWT validation might throw an exception that `The Token can't be used before xxx`.\r\n\r\nI will try to confirm this with a test.\r\n\r\nProposed solutions:\r\n1. We use the `ActorClock` to set the time instead.\r\n2. We remove the `JWT.issuedAt` (`iat`) claim\r\n3. We remove the JWT validation when decoding the JWT token.\r\n\r\nDecision:\r\nWe will implement proposals 2 and 3 from above because:\r\n* We're only using the JWT token for data transport. The JWT token is not signed, and not used outside of Zeebe, so any data other than the authorization data isn't relevant. That means that the `issuedAt` claim can be removed.\r\n* Since the token isn't signed, validation isn't required. Coupled with the bad `issuedAt` implementation, it is causing bugs. It is better to disable the validation since existing Zeebe installations may already face the problem, and we want to disable the validation so that the issue doesn't pop up for existing JWT tokens.\r\n   * In that case, we will need to do our own validation that the `authorized_tenants` JWT claim is present. This can be done by doing a null-check when fetching the claim data since if the claim is not present, a `null` is returned.\r\n\r\ncc @korthout \r\n\n romansmirnov: @koevskinikola, just trying to understand the root cause of the issue, have you been able to validate your hypothesis? Isn't this \"just\" a clock syncing problem between the gateway node and broker node? By setting a leeway when verifying the token, would it help mitigate the issue?\r\n\r\nHowever, please consider this just a question to get a better understanding of the root cause. Meaning, I agree with the decision above to solve the problem anyway 😄 \n koevskinikola: Hey @romansmirnov ,\r\n\r\nI think you're right. It doesn't seem to be time-zone related, but just a matter of leeway.\r\n\r\nThat's because:\r\n1. The JWT library that we use (`java-jwt`) also uses `Instant.now()` inside the `Verifier` to get the current time to compare against.\r\n    * Since we're also using `Instant.now()` to set the `issuedAt` claim, this means the Verifier is always comparing UTC times.\r\n2. The `defaultLeeway` value in `java-jwt` is set to `0`. This means that verifying this token even half a second earlier will cause an issue (this seems to be the case in one of the occurences).\r\n\r\nSo we can definitely adjust the `leeway` to compensate. However, as I pointed out, we're not really signing the JWT token, so the `issuedAt` claim is irrelevant here.\r\n\r\nI would feel more confident in not verifying the `issuedAt` claim at all right now. If we ever decide to expose the JWT data to exported events, we can:\r\n1. Sign it first.\r\n2. Set and adjust the verification for the best-practice claims (like the `issuedAt`)\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI confirmed my hypothesis by:\r\n1. Providing a fixed clock with which I set the `issuedAt` claim on a JWT token.\r\n2. Create a JWT Verifier on which I set a fixed clock 1 second behing.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the JWT verification fails with the same message `The Token can't be used before...`/\n Zelldon: Happened in 8.4.0-alpha1 https://console.cloud.google.com/errors/detail/CI_Y0MHF3fmnggE;service=zeebe;time=P7D?project=zeebe-io but I suspect this fix was not part of the release.\n korthout: Nope 0d600f736e6c1c6cc69cda38d40c78dc4d5abfea is not part of `8.4.0-alpha1`.",

The other partition keeps the partition in the state, tries to correlate again and again but only gets rejections because the receiving partition doesn't know about the subscription anymore.\r\n \r\n## Related Notes\r\n\r\n- It probably doesn't make sense to reject a `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT` command, can't we just clean up the subscription when the receiving partition rejected it?\r\n- Why write `COMMAND_REJECTION`s for internal commands not sent by a user anyway?

This helps offload time-consuming work that could otherwise block the actual workflow processing. \r\n\r\nFor example, job deadlines are checked for expiration by the `JobTimeoutTrigger`, which will append commands for each job to time them out. The stream processor will then process this command asynchronously. Eventually, the job changes state to `TIMED_OUT` when the command is processed. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the `JobTimeoutTrigger` continues to check for expired job deadlines periodically. If the stream processor is blocked, it may happen that the `JobTimeoutTrigger` continues to append the same `Job:TIME_OUT` command. There is nothing that stops it from overloading the stream processor.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many of the scheduled tasks suffer from a similar problem.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\n\r\nScheduled tasks need to keep a cache of recently appended commands (or something similar) that can be used to avoid appending the same command multiple times.\r\n\r\nThis should be available in a generic way, so all scheduled tasks can easily add support for this.\r\n\r\n**Incident**\r\n\r\nFollow up issue from incident: [INC-274: Streamprocessor lagging behind](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8CPBThWtPUxEpmwcoxeb_9pn1eRB2CPpHPiwEVoa3Q/edit#heading=h.hyf892uforsw)\r\n\r\nSupport: \r\n- https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-18291\r\n- https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-18997 \r\n\n\n korthout: Marking this as high impact, as it is a recurring pain. Resolving this would lower the load on clusters experiencing problems where timers, buffered messages, or job timeouts play a role. This would help in the investigation as well as ease recovery.\n abbasadel: I'm increasing the priority of this issue/feature to 'upcoming' since there is a support case waiting for it. \r\nStill, it is highly unlikely to be able to work on this before 8.4. However, we will update the issue once we plan to work on it.\n megglos: ZDP-Planning:\r\n- pushing into the inbox of ZPA to get an update on this as it relates to #14003\n korthout: The ZPA-team discussed this issue again and now considers this a bug. Originally, I felt it was a feature, as we have never supported many timers triggering at once (i.e., there's always a limit somewhere). However, the team feels that outages should not occur from existing features, irrespective of how they are used. Add to this that we don't have documentation about some artibrary limit to the number of timers. Lastly, users feel that this is a bug, and so should we.\r\n\r\nAs a bug, it may be easier to prioritize and release a fix for this as we can backport and patch previous versions.\n dddpaul: @korthout Hi!\r\n\r\nIs there any updates for this bug? I would be nice to have a due date )\n korthout: Hi @dddpaul, the team plans to spend time on this in our current iteration. There's a chance that we can fit a solution in the upcoming patch releases, but we cannot promise this.\n\nWe'll need to consider different solutions. For example, the proposed cache reduces the load on the system in most cases but will not remove the problem completely. Alternatively, ideas like #12560 could help but come with other downsides. The developer(s) working on this issue should consider whether caching is enough or whether another solution might be more fitting. As this is not yet clear, it's possible that a solution will not be ready before the upcoming patch releases. However, we plan to spend time on this issue now.\n Zelldon: There was an L1 blocker again because of this https://jira.camunda.com/plugins/servlet/mobile#issue/SUPPORT-18997 \n\nHandled by @npepinpe \n npepinpe: Users are heavily impacted by this, so I would like to bump this to critical, with a focus on fixing timers. Timers are different from message correlation has they don't involve inter-partition communication, which may help narrow the scope of the fix for now (i.e. writes are guaranteed to succeed).\r\n\r\nThat said, I noticed some possible concurrency issues with the `DueDateTimerChecker`, which could lead to more timers than required being scheduled under high load.\r\n\r\nIf enabled, the `DueDateTimerChecker` runs in the asynchronous scheduler actor, separately from the stream processor.\r\n\r\nHowever, both actors will access the `DueDateTimerChecker`:\r\n\r\n`DueDateTimerChecker#scheduleTimer` is called from the engine/side-effects, i.e. processing actor. It then:\r\n\r\n- Accesses the following state: `shouldRescheduleChecker`, `checkerRunning`, `nextDueDate` (rw)\r\n- Checks if the checker is currently running. This is a non-volatile boolean check.\r\n- If it's not running, it schedules a task.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, scheduling is done on the async scheduler actor. This is the `TriggerEntitiesTask`. It:\r\n\r\n- Accesses the following state: `shouldRescheduleChecker`, `checkerRunning` (rw), `nextDueDate` (rw)\r\n\r\nIs this correct? If so we have non-volatile state being accessed by two different actors, and possibly some race conditions on when and if to schedule the next timer.\r\n\r\nMoving on the the possible solution. In order to keep it light of course, we'd need to to have a way to identify a timer trigger uniquely. Since every time instance can only be scheduled for trigger once in the state, it should be enough to distinguish them with the timer key, which is a single long. \r\n\r\nThe general idea, then, is to cache locally in the `DueDateTimerChecker` state (or some state) which commands have been written, so as to avoid writing them again. A perfect cache would be unbounded - you'd have to possibly store as many timers in there as could possibly exist (worst case scenario).  But a lossy cache is probably acceptable. Take `LongHashSet` from Agrona - an empty, pre-initialized set instance of 1 million keys takes 8MB of memory. Filled, it takes about twice, ~16MB. It's a bit hard to add LRU behavior to such a set however. Eviction could be random to keep things simple/fast, or we can use a `SortedSet`. However, a `TreeSet` takes about ~60MB for 1 million longs, so it's already substantially heavier - but it's pretty easy/fast to add LRU eviction to it. So on the off chance the key was evicted _before_ it was removed explicitly from the cache, you'd potentially still write a second trigger command. But the bigger the cache, the less likely this is to happen.\r\n\r\nI sync'd with @Zelldon today about this, and we decided to move forward with the local cache, only for checkers which perform no inter-partition communication.\r\n\r\nFor timers, we'll use the timer key as the unique cache ID. When iterating of timers, if the timer key is in the cache, then we skip it. Once the task result is built, we can populate the cache with all the timer keys we will be writing. Since the scheduler (even async) is sequenced, we're guaranteed that this write will succeed, or the whole thing will fail (and the cache would be \"restarted\"). We won't be touching things like leader election and so on. On recovery, it's still possible that the same timers would be triggered twice, but the overload load will be greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThis solution is likely adaptable to other checkers which run locally, such as job timeout and message expiry. For messages we can easily use the key. For jobs, we can't use the job key, since you can have multiple activations/time outs. We could use the job key if we can guarantee that the cache is properly cleaned up whenever the job is activated.\r\n\r\nAnyway, long winded comment to say we'll get started on a bounded lossy cache-based prototype.\r\n\r\n\n npepinpe: So in the end, we'll build the cache on the stream processor side. I describe the approach we ended up with in the description of this PR: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15073\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions. For now it's entirely on the stream platform/ZDP side, but it's still useful to know how it works. Plus, if you want to cache future scheduled commands in the future, you'll need to know where to add them :upside_down_face: \n npepinpe: See some benchmark results courtesy of @Zelldon - https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15073#issuecomment-1803887603 :tada: \n korthout: We took it off the ZPA board, as ZDP has found a solution on their side 🙇  Thanks again @Zelldon and @npepinpe \n dddpaul: Hi!\r\n\r\nThis looks like a wonderful job.  But this new timer cache doesn't solve my problem with bunch of UNIQUE timers from DIFFERENT process instances.

We could append these warnings in the incident message to help the user to solve the problem. \r\n\r\nFor example, instead of creating an incident with the message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExpected result of the expression 'date an time (\"2022-03-21T11:15:00@Europe/Berlin\") - now()' to be one of '[DURATION, PERIOD, STRING]', but was 'NULL'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could create an incident with the following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExpected result of the expression 'date an time (\"2022-03-21T11:15:00@Europe/Berlin\") - now()' to be one of '[DURATION, PERIOD, STRING]', but was 'NULL'. \r\nThe evaluation reported the following warnings:  [NO_FUNCTION_FOUND] No function found with name 'date an time' and 1 parameters; [INVALID_TYPE] Can't subtract '2023-09-25T12:00:43.591630872@Etc/UTC' from 'null'\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc: @aleksander-dytko ",

    "gitHubText": "Leaders track the configuration index of all members in the replication group so that it can send a configuration update to outdated members. Previously, the leader only updated the configuration index when receiving a successful configuration response. In cases where a leader initially accepted the current configuration but then loses it again, for example because of dataloss or because it never managed to commit the configuration, the leaders view of the members configuration index remained outdated: The leader thought member B had configuration index X but actually the member has no configuration at all. This could only be resolved by restarting the leader or when creating a new configuration.\r\n\r\nAs a fix, the append response now contains the configuration index. The leader updates the configuration index when it receives an append response. This allows followers to signal to the leader that they have no configuration at all or and outdated one. Before the leader tries to send the next append request, it will first send a configuration request and bring the follower up to date.\r\n\r\nOn the follower side, we now reject append requests if there is not current configuration. The append response has configuration index -1, guaranteeing that the leader will send a configure request next.\r\n\r\n### Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nAdding a new field to the `AppendResponse` is safe, we have done it before: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/14063#discussion_r1311219403\r\n\r\nFollowers from the previous version do not send a configuration index. A leader from the new version will then read a 0 (default value for longs). To prevent that the follower from the previous version is then stuck in a configuration loop, we treat configuration index 0 as a special case and _don't_ update the configuration index. Effectively, we fall back to the old behavior where the configuration index is only updated when a configuration response is sent. This fallback is safe for us because we want to fix a _join_ bug where it's guaranteed that the configuration index is not 0.\r\n\r\nCloses #15381",

    "gitHubText": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen SessionService is constructed, the postConstruct method starts a scheduled deletion of expired session ids. This eventually calls one of the two SessionRepository beans, which makes a static method call to DatabaseInfo.getCurrent(). This is all done during bean creation, and the call to DatabaseInfo is static, so there is no guarantee that the DatabaseInfo bean has been created and the applicationContext set. It is therefore possible to cause a NPE in getCurrent(), which assumed applicationContext had already been set. Adding a guard would eliminate the NPE, but could potentially report the wrong database type when opensearch is used (since Elasticsearch is the default return value). The real solution is to fix the bean creation order so DatabaseInfo is fully instantiated before any implementations of AbstractIndexDescriptor.\r\n\r\n- Added a NPE guard in DatabaseInfo.isCurrent()\r\n- Added a log to output if this function is called before applicationContext has been set\r\n- Added a dependency (through Autowired) in AbstractIndexDescriptor which will force spring to create DatabaseInfo completely before any of the components that extend AbstractIndexDescriptor\r\n\r\nIt is possible this may have to be done in other places, for now this will prevent the NPE and alert us if this happens elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Which issues are closed by this PR or are related -->\r\n\r\ncloses #\r\n\r\n<!-- Cut-off marker\r\n_All lines under and including the cut-off marker will be removed from the merge commit message_\r\n\r\n## Definition of Ready\r\n\r\nPlease check the items that apply, before requesting a review.\r\n\r\nYou can find more details in our [wiki page] (https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/wiki/Pull-Requests-and-Code-Reviews).\r\n\r\n* [ ] I've reviewed my own code\r\n* [x] I've written a clear changelist description\r\n* [x] I've narrowly scoped my changes\r\n* [ ] I've separated structural from behavioural changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Definition of Done\r\n\r\n<!-- As author please check the items that apply before requesting a review. -->\r\n\r\n_Not all items need to be done depending on the issue and the pull request._\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n* [ ] All acceptance criteria described in the issue are met\r\n* [ ] The changes are backwards compatibility with previous versions\r\n* [ ] If it fixes a bug then PRs are created to backport (https://github.com/korthout/backport-action#how-it-works) the fix to the last two minor versions.

I see 2 options here - we can merge a \"copied\" version without a fix in one commit and then a fix in a separate one. Otherwise - yes we can just mark it with a comment in the code. Which one would you prefer?\n matt-whiteman: I think you can avoid having to changing the bean type within all the clients and operations objects since ExtendedOpenSearchClient extends OpenSearchClient. You would just need to update the **fixedSearch** function in OpenSearchDocumentOperations to look like:\r\n\r\n\r\n>  public <R> SearchResponse<R> fixedSearch(SearchRequest request, Class<R> classR) {\r\n>    if (openSearchClient instanceof ExtendedOpenSearchClient) {\r\n>        return safe(() -> (ExtendedOpenSearchClient)openSearchClient.fixedSearch(request, classR), e -> defaultDeleteErrorMessage(request.index().toString()));\r\n>        }\r\n>        else {\r\n>           return search(request, classR);\r\n>        }\r\n>   }\r\n\r\n  \r\n  The benefit of this would be that if the fix ever gets put into the OpenSearch client and we want to remove ExtendedOpenSearchCLient, it's in much fewer places.\n oleksandr-kriuchenko-lohika: > I think you can avoid having to changing the bean type within all the clients and operations objects since ExtendedOpenSearchClient extends OpenSearchClient.

The idea is that it might be accumulating all the necessary fixes and that is the whole purpose of it and the only reason for its existance. But I would gladly listen to alternatives.",

I already posted this question in [ask-zeebe](https://camunda.slack.com/archives/CSQ2E3BT4/p1698768046424059). Unfortunately, on process def deletion, we will not receive any Task delete events as the tasks are removed from runtime state as soon they are completed or terminated. Meaning they already don't exist in Zeebe when the process definition is deleted from Zeebe. So we will receive only one event (or to be more precise, one event per zeebe partition) about process definition deletion and nothing else.\n esraagamal6: @houssain-barouni Can you please review the test cases taking into consideration that it would be executed for both ES and OS?\n houssain-barouni: > @houssain-barouni Can you please review the test cases taking into consideration that it would be executed for both ES and OS?\r\n\r\nI don't have access to TestRail, I opened a ticket to Helpdesk.

One hour is the time required for a completed task to be archived. The archived task should be deleted as well.\n esraagamal6: Testing updates:\r\n\r\n- Completed tasks are removed from Tasklist completed panel when it is deleted via `zbctl delete resoource` but when it is deleted from Operate UI the completed tasks remains in the completed tasks panel in Tasklist -> @houssain-barouni  is investigating this\r\n- **Some** processes could be deleted via `zbctl delete resoource`  although it has running instances and in this case those running instances remains in Tasklist but the task details data is never retrieved in Tasklist UI `\r\n404 Not Found` , but this should not be a blocker because this should be handled in Zeebe team in this [ticket](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15221)\n houssain-barouni: > Testing updates:\r\n> \r\n> * Completed tasks are removed from Tasklist completed panel when it is deleted via `zbctl delete resoource` but when it is deleted from Operate UI the completed tasks remains in the completed tasks panel in Tasklist -> @houssain-barouni  is investigating this\r\n> * **Some** processes could be deleted via `zbctl delete resoource`  although it has running instances and in this case those running instances remains in Tasklist but the task details data is never retrieved in Tasklist UI ` 404 Not Found` , but this should not be a blocker because this should be handled in Zeebe team in this [ticket](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15221)\r\n\r\n@esraagamal6 \r\nI have reproduced the issue:\r\n- Zeebe is configured with 2 partitions\r\n- Some tasks are created on partition 1 , others on partition 2 (depends where the process instance is started)\r\n- When the process is deleted , Zeebe notifies tasklist with partitionId=1 (It is expected to receive notifications for all partitions about process deletion)\r\n- We delete only tasks on partition 1\r\n\r\nI will check with Zeebe team, why notification is sent only for one partition\r\n\r\n**Update:** Actually we are receiving the event for both partitions, I will check why the partition 2 event was skipped\r\n\r\n**Update 2:** I confirm that for PROCESS records we handle the events for one single partition https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/blob/89f0ea75f7835485ffae79184cf34e5d2c3a5ccf/importer/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/zeebeimport/RecordsReaderHolder.java#L54-L55\r\nI will remove the filtering on `partitionId` for the deletion\n esraagamal6: Testing updates:\r\nWhen process  has more than 10 instances to be deleted some of them are displayed in tasklist after deletion on openSearch\n houssain-barouni: > Testing updates: When process has more than 10 instances to be deleted some of them are displayed in tasklist after deletion on openSearch\r\n\r\n@esraagamal6 \r\nScrolling in Opensearch was broken (it affects also master), we were fetching only 10 first results only. I have fixed it.\r\nExample of usecase affected by broken opensearch scrolling in master:\r\n- Create 11 tasks having a variable varA=foo\r\n- Do a search task query with varA=foo\r\n- You will notice that only 10 tasks are returned instead of 11\n esraagamal6: @houssain-barouni Tested OK",

This comment has been updated with latest results.\n marcosgvieira: @nathansandi Is this still a draft or is it ready to review?\n nathansandi: Hi @marcosgvieira I just moved to review\r\n\r\nIt was a draft, in the time I open because I was trying to reproduce the error (but could not for tasks), but at the same time I think its a gain to put this in PROD to prevent bugs related to nullable fields on  JSON. \n marcosgvieira: @nathansandi, just for my understanding what happens when the `return objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);` against the \"null\" value that causes the error?\n nathansandi: > @nathansandi, just for my understanding what happens when the `return objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);` against the \"null\" value that causes the error?\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar to Start Process by a form (PS: Maybe this was already threaten over forms for Tasks), when calling objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);, Jackson (the underlying library used by objectMapper) attempts to deserialize the JSON string in variable.getValue() into a Java object of type Object. The problem arises when the JSON string represents the literal string \"null\" rather than the JSON null value.\r\n\r\nIn JSON, the value null is a special keyword indicating the absence of a value or a null value. It's not represented as a string, but as the literal null. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"someKey\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn contrast, if you have a string \"null\" in your JSON, it is treated as a regular string and not a null value:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"someKey\": \"null\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, when you attempt to deserialize the string \"null\" into an Object using objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);, Jackson tries to parse it as a regular string, not as the special null value, resulting in the actual string \"null\" being returned.\r\n\r\nTo handle this situation, I've added a check:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (variable.getValue().equals(\"null\")) {\r\n  return \"null\"; // JSON Object null must be instanced like \"null\", also should not send to\r\n  // objectMapper null values\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis check ensures that if the variable.getValue() is the string \"null,\" you return the string \"null\" instead of trying to deserialize it using Jackson. This way, you're preserving the original intent of the \"null\" string in your JSON data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n marcosgvieira: > So, when you attempt to deserialize the string \"null\" into an Object using objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);, Jackson tries to parse it as a regular string, not as the special null value, resulting in the actual string \"null\" being returned.\r\n\r\nSo isn't it the same result as the new condition we are adding?\n nathansandi: > So isn't it the same result as the new condition we are adding?\r\n\r\nYes, In such a case, you explicitly return the string \"null\" without attempting to deserialize it using objectMapper.\r\nThe problem would be if go to Object mapper with the \"null\" value \r\n\r\nThis code is handling both the case where the input is the string \"null\" and the case where it's a valid JSON string. The added condition ensures that you handle the special case of the string \"null\" without attempting unnecessary deserialization. The error was caused when goes to Object Mapper, trying to serialize the null json value\r\n\n marcosgvieira: > e the input is the string \"null\" and the case where it's a valid JSON string. The added condition ensures that you handle the special case of the string \"null\" without attempting unnecessary deserialization. The error was caused when goes to Object Mapper, trying to serialize the null json value\r\n\r\nThen if the result is the same I don't think we are fixing any error as the behavior is the same (also we are adding a condition to all the cases to try to avoid a deserialization in a case that doesn't happen so often) - should we really add this condition? The #3585 also cannot be closed by this PR as it's covered in another task by @houssain-barouni can you check if you referenced the right ticket?\n marcosgvieira: After a chat with @nathansandi he explained that when passing \"null\" to the objectMapper a NullPointer is throwed, so this is the reason for the condition.\n github-actions[bot]: Successfully created backport PR for `stable/8.3`:\n- #3810\n github-actions[bot]: Successfully created backport PR for `stable/8.2`:\n- #3811",

This makes it easy to pull the Identity version that's being used in other project that depend on this SDK during runtime.\r\n\r\nI made this change to improve the E2E testing in Zeebe. We spin up a container of the Identity SNAPSHOT. This ivery fault-sensitive as the SNAPSHOT could change at any time. It also becomes an issue when supporting older versions, as the old SDK might not align with the SNAPSHOT version. By adding this information we can easily get the version that we depend on during runtime and use this for Docker image in our E2E tests.\r\n\r\n### Is there anything else to consider?\r\n<!-- As a suggestion, were any alternatives considered?

Have we found a more performant way to solve the problem? -->\r\n\r\nAs described in the linked issue, there appears to be a clashing of dependency versions for the jupiter artifacts, setting the versions via a `dependencyManagement` block doesn't seem to be successful (more exploration could be good here), so I have opted for a two fold approach:\r\n\r\n1. Set the Jupiter versions to a version that works\r\n2. Configure the maven failsafe plugin to fail the build if no tests are run during the verify stage for the management-api artifact.\r\n\r\nThe first point is clear, the second point is an extra layer of protection, we know that there are ITs that run during the validation phase in the `management-api` module so seeing no tests run is not expected (unless the tests are skipped using `-DskipTests=true` though the build is still successful in this instance.\r\n\r\n### Is there anything else to consider?\r\n<!-- As a suggestion, were any alternatives considered? Is there any particular decision you'd like to highlight? -->\r\n\r\nI tried to think of different ways to work through the dependency clashes but they felt at best like I was sticking a plaster over things and not letting Maven use its built in logic for dependency resolution (by for example excluding the dependency from spring-boot-test` or forcing the version).\r\n\r\nI believe that for now (and to get our builds back to a credible position) this change is sufficient. \r\n\n",

Have we found a more performant way to solve the problem? -->\r\n\r\nI noticed whilst putting together an example set of configuration for tenants that currently there is a exception when trying to assign members in configuration, which is:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: io.camunda.identity.entity.AccessRule.tenants: could not initialize proxy - no Session\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at it I can see that the code fails when we try to retrieve the tenants for the access rule that we want to assign a member to, frustratingly we have tests for this behaviour but it seems that the Hibernate session is extending to allow the tests to pass...\r\n\r\nHaving [read a little about the options to resolve this](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-initialize-proxy-exception) I decided to opt for the `JOIN FETCH` approach as mentioned [here](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-initialize-proxy-exception#4-using-join-fetching) because using `FetchType.EAGER` is generally discouraged.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\n- [x] Code changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Design review requested or not required\r\n\n\n Infra-connect: Successfully created backport PR for `v8.3`:\n- #2183",

This is because after restore, raft metastore is empty. So it restarts the term from 1. This is ok so far.

This leads to inconsistency. \r\n\r\n**Impact**\r\nIf it happens immediately after restore before writing any new data, it should be safe to restart the brokers. Due to the above error, the new leader Zeebe-0 cannot commit anything. So, as a result there won't be any actual data inconsistency. If we wait until all nodes are healthy before restarting the traffic to the cluster, this will not lead to any actual data inconsistency because no user requests has been processed yet. However, if there are new user data that has been processed, then there is a possibility for partial data loss. **Note that the data recovered from the backup won't be lost if this happens. Only new data will be affected.**\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFollowing scenario can lead to this error:\r\n1. A, B, C restored from the same backup, where the term of the last entry in the log is > 1\r\n2. A, B forms the quorum and A became the leader\r\n3. A and B committed new entries \r\n4. C does not know about the new leader. So it starts new election.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAfter, restoring from a backup raft can continue working in all scenarios.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n- Zeebe Version: Observed in 8.2.13\r\n\r\nRelates to [https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174)\r\n\n\n nicpuppa: This affect also a SM customer ([support case](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174)). In this case the problem was with `term`. Since it is reset, no new snapshots can be taken until the term increases to a higher value than the one before the backup. As a result, logs are not compacted and disk usage grows high.\r\n\r\nFixed by this [PR](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15272)",

As a result the command could be accepted on the receiving partition, but keeps getting rejected on other partition where there may be a banned instance.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n**Scenario 1**\r\nA user is unable to delete a process definition because there is a banned instance which causes the command to be rejected.\r\n\r\n**Scenario 2**\r\nA user deletes a process definition. The command is accepted and distributed. The partition that it gets distributed to has a banned instance. As a result it will never send an acknowledgment. The distributing partition will retry the command distribution indefinitely. This will happen every 5 minutes.\r\nIn the meantime users will still be able to start new instances for the process definition. However, this will be flaky as the definition is deleted on some partitions, but not on others. There is a state inconsistency until this bug is resolved.\n",

Could you please have a look?\n npepinpe: We had a look together, and AFAIK this is the same behavior as ever. We were always calling `workerName` in the constructor of the command, and it makes sense to me to follow Simon's suggestion and only apply defaults in the build method, not in the constructor.\r\n\r\nEDIT: here's the commit which introduced setting the worker name as the default configuration: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/06f4e463efd3ca1be67056660f12abd4ad7867d8/clients/java/src/main/java/io/zeebe/client/impl/job/ActivateJobsCommandImpl.java#L46\r\n\r\nThat's from 2018, so it looks to me like this was always the behavior. The only thing I can imagine would be that _maybe_ the gRPC behavior changed, where they simply don't allow null values anymore, but I doubt it. I suspect if we check, it was always like this.\n npepinpe: > Looks like it happens as the command builder is used instead of the previously used request builder since: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/commit/359a402b5bbee7247749385a458c5b3f3aba7e78\r\n\r\n@sbuettner - can you point out to me where the change from request to command builder happened? From the commit, the code is the same - we extracted an interface out of a class, but the implementation was not changed.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the \"old\" implementation:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    final ActivateJobsCommandStep3 activateCommand =\r\n        jobClient\r\n            .newActivateJobsCommand()\r\n            .jobType(jobType)\r\n            .maxJobsToActivate(maxJobsToActivate)\r\n            .timeout(timeout)\r\n            .workerName(workerName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it was simply moved in the \"new\" one, but remains the same:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    final ActivateJobsCommandStep3 activateCommand =\r\n        jobClient\r\n            .newActivateJobsCommand()\r\n            .jobType(jobType)\r\n            .maxJobsToActivate(maxJobsToActivate)\r\n            .timeout(timeout)\r\n            .workerName(workerName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure what you mean by request vs command builder :thinking: \n sbuettner: @npepinpe It looks like it was changed here: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/commit/11c548dd4d46f62119a600da0dc1abad7231c417#diff-7101968ae21254c317a1606e4a1969ec3864b538403541ecc7161351b2bd38ddL86\n npepinpe: Good catch! Seems unrelated to job push, but it is indeed a regression in that sense for 8.3.0. I'll defer to the ZPA team on what the priority for it is.\n korthout: Thanks @npepinpe and @sbuettner for the extra input.\r\n\r\n- We'll need to fix this before 8.3 as it regressed recently.\r\n- We consider this mid severity, as a workaround is available (don't set null as the default job worker name)\r\n- We wonder how quickly a user would run into this, do you have to set `null` explicitly, or does it also occur when the client doesn't define any default?\r\n- This would change the impact dramatically, and so our priority\r\n- We want to timebox whether that is the case\r\n- It might be worth it to fix immediately then (but please timebox it)",

Looking at the dashboard there's 70+ banned instances. We must find out where this is coming from and resolve it asap.\n deepthidevaki: The pods also encountered SIGSEGV. Looks like it is also caused when reading msgpack.\r\n[error.log](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/files/12828385/error.log)\r\n\n remcowesterhoud: After root-causing I've lowered the severity from `critical` to `high`. This is because this issue only occurs when job push is enabled, which is an experimental api. Because of this we can fix this in a patch release.\r\n\r\n**Root-cause**\r\nThe problem lies in the job streamer. This is an object that only exists once per broker. This instance is shared between the partition on the broker. If a broker is leader for more than 1 partition, iterating through the tenants in the `JobActivationPropertiesImpl` will fail, as the ArrayProperty is not thread-safe.\r\n\r\n**Quick-fix**\r\nWe can clone [the job activation properties in the `BpmnJobActivationBehavior`](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/engine/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/engine/processing/bpmn/behavior/BpmnJobActivationBehavior.java#L67-L70), before we get the list of tenants. Because we have a copy we'll no longer have multiple partitions iterating over the same `ArrayProperty`.\r\n\r\n**Nicer fix**\r\nThe engine always assumes everything is single-threaded. This makes it very easy to make changes in the engine. The job streamer is now the exception. If the broker can register streams per partition, instead of reusing the streamer we'll no longer have multiple partitions interacting with the same instance. This resolves the problem.\n npepinpe: Isn't the real issue that iterating over a supposedly immutable `ArrayProperty` actually mutates the object? :sweat_smile: The stream registry expects all its information to be immutable, so when `JobActivationPropertiesImpl` is, in fact, mutable, it's what causes the design dissonance.\r\n\r\nI think almost all of us got bitten by the fact that iterating over an `ArrayValue` mutates the underlying object, which is (much like the Spanish inquisition) never what you expect. You can see so many of these objects where we clone the array property to a list or something before iterating for this specific reason. For example, `JobBatchRecord#getJobKeys`.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I wouldn't propose registering streams per partition - it's just redundant work. Instead, you can wrap the given `JobStreamer` in a partition aware facade which can copy info when you need it.\n npepinpe: This came up in our planning - should I work on this? Will you work on this? If so, should I assume that, since it's in `ready`, it will be in the next 2 weeks?\n remcowesterhoud: Sorry, I put it in ready because we thought it was a critical issue and release blocker. We may have time for the quick-fix this week, but we have to prioritise documentation for the release. We want this to be part of 8.3.1 release.\r\n\r\nWe haven't decided yet on which approach we should take. If we have a separate job streamer for each partition I'd say it falls under ZDP responsibility. The quick-fix we can definitely do ourselves. Iterating over the ArrayProperty without mutating it sounds great too and would also be our responsibility.\n Zelldon: [Run into this issue as well when using cloud benchmark with SaaS cluster with v8.3.0](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=resource.type%3D%22k8s_container%22%0Aresource.labels.project_id%3D%22camunda-saas-prod%22%0Aresource.labels.location%3D%22northamerica-northeast2%22%0Aresource.labels.cluster_name%3D%22worker-5%22%0Aresource.labels.namespace_name%3D%222b3d50c8-e590-4eba-97d4-1da76e0d8fb4-zeebe%22%0Aresource.labels.pod_name:%22zeebe-%22%0A-resource.labels.container_name%3D%22zeebe-analytics%22;pinnedLogId=2023-10-10T14:22:20.739210406Z%2Fbvjumarl3k64dbew;cursorTimestamp=2023-10-10T14:22:28.849604018Z;startTime=2023-10-10T13:24:40.544024Z;endTime=2023-10-10T15:24:40.544Z?project=camunda-saas-prod)\r\n\r\njust want to highlight that this makes job push right now totally unusable.\n megglos: > We haven't decided yet on which approach we should take.

It can run concurrently to the stream processor, where the two access a shared in-memory state (aka transient state). Access to this state is threadsafe, but not spread over multiple calls.\r\n\r\nThe race condition appears to exist here: The entries are first retrieved from the transient state, before we `get` the subscription from the persisted state. The transient state may have been modified before, leading to both states not being in-sync.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/d928ba2ed6321b3e613320e9c7fcdd0bc0decc44/engine/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/engine/state/message/DbMessageSubscriptionState.java#L229-L236\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\nIf possible add a minimal reproducer code sample\r\n- when using the Java client: https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-test-template-java\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis may be hard to reproduce, as it's a race condition.

The new leader did not run into the same race condition.\r\n- The race condition has already been around since 8.3.0-alpha3, and did not occur in our extensive testing. It's a rare occurrence.\r\n- Lastly, users that do run into this too often can disable the checker from running concurrently to stream processor by setting `zeebe.broker.processing.enableAsyncScheduledTasks: false`. This will completely mitigate this issue.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, this issue is high severity as it disrupts regular processing, causing a drop in availability.\n korthout: It's possible that this is similar to this issue for timers:\r\n- https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/13598\n berkaycanbc: @korthout do you think we can move this one to ready so that it can be picked up? I can take a look at it.\n berkaycanbc: We can add a null check and log that subscription removed from the state if it is not found. Since message subscription record either correlated or deleted from the state, it should be safe to skip that record. WDYT? @korthout \n korthout: @berkaycanbc Sounds like a good plan. Feel free to pick it up. 👍  Please make sure to verify whether this race condition exists on previous versions (i.e. 8.2)",

This you configure the worker/starter to use TLS or not?\n Zelldon: Before it just worked when setting the credentials, so this changed?\n npepinpe: From what I can tell, the benchmark apps haven't changed since 8.1.8, so maybe it's the client? :shrug: \r\n\r\nDid we use to enable TLS automatically if you had credentials maybe? I'd have to check.\n npepinpe: I'd be curious if you just tried setting the credentials/env vars, and then also the TLS application config if it works.\n Zelldon: > Did we use to enable TLS automatically if you had credentials maybe? I'd have to check.\r\n\r\nThis is how it worked before afaik.\n npepinpe: While this may be a regression if that previous behavior has changed, I'm setting this as low severity since it's just a matter of properly configuring it. Could you confirm that with proper configuration it works @Zelldon ? If not, then we can treat it as higher severity.\r\n\r\nSo for now I'm putting this in the backlog until then.\n Zelldon: TBH that is quite problematic, since it is totally unclear to the user what is the problem it took me quite a long time to understand and find the root cause.\n megglos: there is actually a config [for tls which is set to enabled](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/benchmarks/setup/cloud-default/starter.yaml#L26) I will check why it isn't used properly.\r\n\r\nThis impacted QA when they wanted to make use of the benchmark for generating datasets.",

One thing I've noticed about this dockerfile, is that /usr/local/operate is owned by either root or 1000, and not by the user that we switch to (user id 1004).  This often becomes a problem when ZEEBE_CLIENT_CONFIG_PATH is not set, which means it uses the home directory by default.  But I get around that by creating a volume on /tmp and then setting ZEEBE_CLIENT_CONFIG_PATH to /tmp/randomfilepath .\r\n\r\nIn helm, everythings running in read-only mode, which means creating volumes is mandatory.   but our compose file in camunda-platform is not running in read-only mode, so it runs into permission issues on /usr/local/operate.\r\n\r\nI created a image, and tested it myself and everything comes up fine. So I'm good with these changes :+1: \n sdorokhova: @johanwelgemoed did you try to test the changes in any way? I see that Docker test is failing and branch is also not deploying. Could you please check this?\n johanwelgemoed: @sdorokhova How I tested it was\r\n1. locally via docker-compose running only Zeebe and Operate - both on OpenSearch and Elasticsearch\r\n2. created and pushed a docker image to gcr.io an then created a cluster on Int to test there. Also seemed to work there\r\nI di not test other than that\n sdorokhova: @johanwelgemoed that's great to hear!

It updates the `getForm` method in both `FormStoreElasticSearch.java` and `FormStoreOpenSearch.java` to handle different scenarios of form retrieval based on form id, process definition id, and version. It also adds new methods to check if a form is associated with a task or a process. Additionally, it includes updates to the unit tests and integration tests to cover these new scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Main Files Walkthrough\r\n\r\n- **[els-schema/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/store/elasticsearch/FormStoreElasticSearch.java]**: The `getForm` method is updated to handle different scenarios of form retrieval based on form id, process definition id, and version. New methods `getFormEmbedded`, `getLinkedForm`, `isFormAssociatedToTask`, and `isFormAssociatedToProcess` are added to support these scenarios.\r\n- **[els-schema/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/store/opensearch/FormStoreOpenSearch.java]**: Similar to `FormStoreElasticSearch.java`, the `getForm` method is updated and new methods are added to handle different scenarios of form retrieval.\r\n- **[webapp/src/test/java/io/camunda/tasklist/webapp/api/rest/v1/controllers/FormControllerTest.java]**: New test cases are added to cover the different scenarios of form retrieval.

This makes it easy to pull the Identity version that's being used in other project that depend on this SDK during runtime.\r\n\r\nI made this change to improve the E2E testing in Zeebe. We spin up a container of the Identity SNAPSHOT. This ivery fault-sensitive as the SNAPSHOT could change at any time. It also becomes an issue when supporting older versions, as the old SDK might not align with the SNAPSHOT version. By adding this information we can easily get the version that we depend on during runtime and use this for Docker image in our E2E tests.\r\n\r\n### Is there anything else to consider?\r\n<!-- As a suggestion, were any alternatives considered?

Have we found a more performant way to solve the problem? -->\r\n\r\nI noticed whilst putting together an example set of configuration for tenants that currently there is a exception when trying to assign members in configuration, which is:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: failed to lazily initialize a collection of role: io.camunda.identity.entity.AccessRule.tenants: could not initialize proxy - no Session\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at it I can see that the code fails when we try to retrieve the tenants for the access rule that we want to assign a member to, frustratingly we have tests for this behaviour but it seems that the Hibernate session is extending to allow the tests to pass...\r\n\r\nHaving [read a little about the options to resolve this](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-initialize-proxy-exception) I decided to opt for the `JOIN FETCH` approach as mentioned [here](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-initialize-proxy-exception#4-using-join-fetching) because using `FetchType.EAGER` is generally discouraged.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance criteria\r\n- [x] Code changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Design review requested or not required\r\n\n\n Infra-connect: Successfully created backport PR for `v8.3`:\n- #2183",
