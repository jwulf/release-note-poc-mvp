This lack of backoff strategy could lead to excessive load, especially during high-error periods.\n \nPrevious iterations of the Go client didn’t include a backoff mechanism like the one in the Java client. This mechanism is essential to reduce strain on the system because it delays the worker's next poll for available jobs upon receiving an error from the gateway.\n \nA default exponential backoff mechanism was added to the Go client, mirroring the Java client's approach. This new functionality includes customizable settings for maxDelay, minDelay, backoffFactor, and jitterFactor, and the capacity for users to provide their own implementation of a backoff strategy. \n \nWith the fix in place, when the job poller in the Go client encounters an error, it will now implement a delay before polling for available jobs again. This delay increases exponentially with each error to a maximum delay limit, effectively reducing strain when errors occur. Users can customize backoff parameters or provide their own strategy for increased flexibility and optimization."

Consequently, users were unable to perform job commands (e.g., activate, fail, throwError, yield, complete, etc.) on migrated instances.\n This issue was caused because there was no `JobIntent` `MIGRATED` and the `ProcessInstanceMigration` command processor did not account for child instances of the type `SERVICE_TASK`. Thus, during the process instance migration, the properties of the job (like - `bpmnProcessId`, `processDefinitionVersion`, `processDefinitionKey`, and `elementId`) did not get updated as they should have.\n To rectify this, a new `JobIntent` `MIGRATED` was introduced. Furthermore, changes were made to the `ProcessInstanceMigration` command processor: for each child instance, a `ProcessInstance:ELEMENT_MIGRATED` event is appended. If this child is of type `SERVICE_TASK`, a `Job:MIGRATED` event is also appended. This ensures that all necessary properties are updated leading to successful migration of service task instances and jobs.\n With these fixes, users can now successfully migrate process instances, and properly use all job commands on these migrated instances. Migration is seamless and all properties of the jobs are updated appropriately.\n"

Since Broker-1 was committed that first part of the joint consensus and restarted, this left partition 2 in Broker-2 unstarted. This caused Broker-0, the leader, to commit the second part of the joint consensus before Broker-2 was ready, causing Broker-2 to indefinitely wait for partition-2 to be ready.\n \nThis was fixed by ensuring that Broker-2 becomes ready before Broker-1 is restarted. This way, the second part of joint consensus isn't committed before Broker-2 is fully ready.\n \nNow, when users attempt to merge changes, timeouts are no longer an issue, and operations can be performed without being cancelled prematurely. The system's operations run smoothly without unexpectedly waiting for partitions to be ready, boosting the efficiency of the operations."

Theorized as a result of a lost `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/CORRELATE` or `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/DELETE` command, prompting a recurring loop of resend attempts and consequent rejections.\n Instead of focusing on just preventing a recurrence, the team sought to find a way to recover from the broken state. Possible improvements include not rejecting a `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT` command, not writing `COMMAND_REJECTION`s for internal commands, and effectively cleaning up subscription when the receiving partition rejects it. \n With these improvements implemented, the software is now effective in recovering from a faulty state, preventing potential processing load build-ups.

As a result, the broker was unable to reach a bootloop which was causing headache for users who attempted to boot their systems.\n \nThe underlying issue turned out to be, most likely, a corruption in snapshots. The problematic snapshot appeared during the initialization of the RaftContext. During the creation of the snapshot, the broker was shutting down, and the system integration check failed to function properly after the shut down. This led to the snapshot being moved to the Raft thread instead, which led to the corruption.\n \nThe issue was addressed by introducing a proper synchronization process where a persist operation must first be completed before any other action can be taken on the Raft thread. This prevented the half-complete snapshot from being pushed to the Raft. In addition, the checksum file was also corrected to prevent the snapshot from being improperly flagged as corrupted.\nNow, the broker no longer gets stuck in a bootloop due to snapshot corruption. It properly waits for the persist operation to complete before moving on to the next processes. Thus, data integrity is maintained, and users are able to boot their system without disruption."

The leader had an incorrect understanding of the member's configuration status, thinking it had a configuration index when it actually did not have one. This could only be corrected by restarting the leader or creating a new configuration.\n The underlying flaw was that leaders would only update the configuration index when they received a successful configuration response. This left room for inconsistencies when there were disruptions or failures in the communication, leading to the leader having an outdated perception of the member's configuration index.\n Two main changes were implemented. Firstly, the configuration index was integrated into the append response, allowing the leader to update the configuration index when this response was received. Secondly, followers can now reject append requests if there is no current configuration, signalling to the leader that a configuration request is required.\n Now, leaders accurately track members' configuration status and can update wrongly perceived configuration indexes. Followers can also reflect their actual configuration status back to the leaders. This change ensures the system can accurately monitor and respond to configuration changes and disruptions, improving the consistency and reliability of the system."

The system now checks for the presence of all aliases at startup and re-adds any if they are missing. Upsert queries are used instead of update queries to safely handle instances of data loss.

And finally, the system was updated to ignore missing parent process instances and flow node instances, allow the import to continue, and log warnings about missing data. \nPost this fix, Operate is resilient to random data loss and continues running smoothly even if Operate/Zeebe indices/aliases are deleted from Elastic.

This issue would only occur if a scheduled deletion of expired session ids led to a static method call to DatabaseInfo.getCurrent() before the DatabaseInfo bean had been fully created.\nThis issue was caused by inconsistencies in bean creation order. Because the session id cleanup task runs during the SessionService bean's construction and makes a static method call to DatabaseInfo, there was a possibility that DatabaseInfo had not been fully instantiated. This led to an NPE in getCurrent(), which assumed the applicationContext was already set.\nThis problem was rectified by changing the bean creation order to ensure DatabaseInfo is fully instantiated before any implementations of AbstractIndexDescriptor. An NPE guard was added to DatabaseInfo.isCurrent() along with a log to indicate if this function is called before applicationContext is set. Additionally, a dependency was added in AbstractIndexDescriptor (through Autowired) to force full creation of DatabaseInfo before any components that extend AbstractIndexDescriptor are created.\nFollowing these changes, users should no longer experience the aforementioned NPE.

This created clutter and confusion in the Tasklist. \n The system didn't have an action to handle the deletion of process definition related objects in Tasklist upon the deletion of a Process definition event.\n A feature was implemented that deletes related objects in the Tasklist on the deleting of a Process definition event. Tasks on the partition provided in Zeebe record, TaskVariables, the Process entity, and Embedded forms are deleted accordingly. \n Now, users can see that upon deleting a Process definition, all related objects in the Tasklist are also deleted. This clears away any related objects that are no longer in use, leading to a clean and straightforward user experience."
