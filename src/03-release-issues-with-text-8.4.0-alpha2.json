    "gitHubText": "**Description**\r\n\r\n#6093 provides a backoff mechanism for the java client's job worker. When an error is received from the gateway by the job poller, the worker delays its next poll for available jobs. The go client should support the same functionality.\r\n\r\nThis functionality should be the same as the java client's. Including:\r\n- a default exponential backoff mechanism with the same defaults: {maxDelay:5s, minDelay:50ms, backoffFactor:1.6, jitterFactor:0.1}\r\n- the exponential backoff should be configurable\r\n- users should be able to provide their own implementation of a backoff strategy\r\n- backoff should only occur on errors received on the poll for available jobs\n\n Sijoma: Hey yall, I did a implementation for this for the go client. I'm a bit unsure in which cases the backoff should be applied though. \r\n\r\nIs it every time there is a ResourceExhausted? Or also when it fails to reopen the job polling stream? Is here: `clients/go/pkg/worker/jobPoller.go:95` the correct place?\r\n\r\n\n korthout: The backoff should be applied when the job poller fails to ask for jobs from the gateway. For example, in Java, [it backs off when any exception is thrown during the polling for jobs](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/069c17a74398d291b95d1c761357a457c62257ae/clients/java/src/main/java/io/zeebe/client/impl/worker/JobWorkerImpl.java#L136-L147). So that it actually controlled from the JobWorker, the poller is just used once in a while by the job worker.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen differently in the go client, but the details are a bit unclear to me. Somewhere [around here](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/clients/go/pkg/worker/jobPoller.go#L77-L114) would be my guess. \r\n\r\nI think that this part is the [main loop](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/main/clients/go/pkg/worker/jobPoller.go#L47-L71) for the poller. It seems to:\r\n- poll for jobs, and add them to the job queue\r\n- determine if it if needs to poll again\r\n\r\nSo, what is needed is some way to backoff from polling when an error occurs during polling. There are [other errors](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/apis-clients/grpc/#technical-error-handling) than `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` that could occur during polling.\n Sijoma: Thanks for the info @korthout, indeed it looks a bit differently in the go client. I will put in a draft-pr :). ",

This is because after restore, raft metastore is empty. So it restarts the term from 1. This is ok so far. But after Zeebe-2 becomes the leader and commits its InitialEntry at index `3983`, Zeebe-0 starts election probably because it did not receive any heartbeat from the leader `Zeebe-2`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO 2023-09-26T11:26:01.569385207Z [jsonPayload.context.partitionId: 26] [resource.labels.podName: zeebe-1] RaftServer{raft-partition-partition-26}{role=FOLLOWER} - Accepted PollRequest{term=1, candidate=0, lastLogIndex=3982, lastLogTerm=2}: candidate's log is up-to-date\r\nINFO 2023-09-26T11:26:01.577404370Z [jsonPayload.context.partitionId: 26] [resource.labels.podName: zeebe-1] RaftServer{raft-partition-partition-26}{role=FOLLOWER} - Accepted VoteRequest{term=2, candidate=0, lastLogIndex=3982, lastLogTerm=2}: candidate's log is up-to-date\r\nINFO 2023-09-26T11:26:01.582069421Z [jsonPayload.context.partitionId: 26] [resource.labels.podName: zeebe-1] RaftServer{raft-partition-partition-26} - Found leader 0\r\n```\r\nZeebe-1 accepts poll request from Zeebe-0 because Zeebe-0's lastLogTerm > Zeebe-1's current term 1. This leads to inconsistency. \r\n\r\n**Impact**\r\nIf it happens immediately after restore before writing any new data, it should be safe to restart the brokers. Due to the above error, the new leader Zeebe-0 cannot commit anything. So, as a result there won't be any actual data inconsistency. If we wait until all nodes are healthy before restarting the traffic to the cluster, this will not lead to any actual data inconsistency because no user requests has been processed yet. However, if there are new user data that has been processed, then there is a possibility for partial data loss. **Note that the data recovered from the backup won't be lost if this happens. Only new data will be affected.**\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFollowing scenario can lead to this error:\r\n1. A, B, C restored from the same backup, where the term of the last entry in the log is > 1\r\n2. A, B forms the quorum and A became the leader\r\n3. A and B committed new entries \r\n4. C does not know about the new leader. So it starts new election.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAfter, restoring from a backup raft can continue working in all scenarios.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n- Zeebe Version: Observed in 8.2.13\r\n\r\nRelates to [https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174)\r\n\n\n nicpuppa: This affect also a SM customer ([support case](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19174)). In this case the problem was with `term`. Since it is reset, no new snapshots can be taken until the term increases to a higher value than the one before the backup. As a result, logs are not compacted and disk usage grows high.\r\n\r\nFixed by this [PR](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15272)",

Could you share them in a comment?\n koevskinikola: Related to a [SUPPORT case](https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19112) as well.\n koevskinikola: My hypothesis is that this is a time zone issue.\r\n\r\n1. We're using `Instance.now()` to set the `JWT#issuedAt` (`iat`) claim [here](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/blob/6a730a7bf57f0491cb0b29e5b2c90533330b6c1b/auth/src/main/java/io/camunda/zeebe/auth/impl/JwtAuthorizationEncoder.java#L66).\r\n2. The `Instance.now()` method provides an `Instant` from the system UTC clock.\r\n3. If the cluster is set on a different time zone, the JWT validation might throw an exception that `The Token can't be used before xxx`.\r\n\r\nI will try to confirm this with a test.\r\n\r\nProposed solutions:\r\n1. We use the `ActorClock` to set the time instead.\r\n2. We remove the `JWT.issuedAt` (`iat`) claim\r\n3. We remove the JWT validation when decoding the JWT token.\r\n\r\nDecision:\r\nWe will implement proposals 2 and 3 from above because:\r\n* We're only using the JWT token for data transport. The JWT token is not signed, and not used outside of Zeebe, so any data other than the authorization data isn't relevant. That means that the `issuedAt` claim can be removed.\r\n* Since the token isn't signed, validation isn't required. Coupled with the bad `issuedAt` implementation, it is causing bugs. It is better to disable the validation since existing Zeebe installations may already face the problem, and we want to disable the validation so that the issue doesn't pop up for existing JWT tokens.\r\n   * In that case, we will need to do our own validation that the `authorized_tenants` JWT claim is present. This can be done by doing a null-check when fetching the claim data since if the claim is not present, a `null` is returned.\r\n\r\ncc @korthout \r\n\n romansmirnov: @koevskinikola, just trying to understand the root cause of the issue, have you been able to validate your hypothesis? Isn't this \"just\" a clock syncing problem between the gateway node and broker node? By setting a leeway when verifying the token, would it help mitigate the issue?\r\n\r\nHowever, please consider this just a question to get a better understanding of the root cause. Meaning, I agree with the decision above to solve the problem anyway 😄 \n koevskinikola: Hey @romansmirnov ,\r\n\r\nI think you're right. It doesn't seem to be time-zone related, but just a matter of leeway.\r\n\r\nThat's because:\r\n1. The JWT library that we use (`java-jwt`) also uses `Instant.now()` inside the `Verifier` to get the current time to compare against.\r\n    * Since we're also using `Instant.now()` to set the `issuedAt` claim, this means the Verifier is always comparing UTC times.\r\n2. The `defaultLeeway` value in `java-jwt` is set to `0`. This means that verifying this token even half a second earlier will cause an issue (this seems to be the case in one of the occurences).\r\n\r\nSo we can definitely adjust the `leeway` to compensate. However, as I pointed out, we're not really signing the JWT token, so the `issuedAt` claim is irrelevant here.\r\n\r\nI would feel more confident in not verifying the `issuedAt` claim at all right now. If we ever decide to expose the JWT data to exported events, we can:\r\n1. Sign it first.\r\n2. Set and adjust the verification for the best-practice claims (like the `issuedAt`)\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI confirmed my hypothesis by:\r\n1. Providing a fixed clock with which I set the `issuedAt` claim on a JWT token.\r\n2. Create a JWT Verifier on which I set a fixed clock 1 second behing.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the JWT verification fails with the same message `The Token can't be used before...`/\n Zelldon: Happened in 8.4.0-alpha1 https://console.cloud.google.com/errors/detail/CI_Y0MHF3fmnggE;service=zeebe;time=P7D?project=zeebe-io but I suspect this fix was not part of the release.\n korthout: Nope 0d600f736e6c1c6cc69cda38d40c78dc4d5abfea is not part of `8.4.0-alpha1`.",

On the other partition, the subscription column family does not contain such an entry.\r\nHypothesis: A `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/CORRELATE` or  `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/DELETE`command was lost, leaking the subscription entry. `ProcessMessageSubscriptionCorrelateProcessor` handles non interrupting subscriptions by removing them from the state immediately and then sending `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/CORRELATE` just once. If that command is lost, nothing will resend it. The other partition keeps the partition in the state, tries to correlate again and again but only gets rejections because the receiving partition doesn't know about the subscription anymore.\r\n \r\n## Related Notes\r\n\r\n- It probably doesn't make sense to reject a `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT` command, can't we just clean up the subscription when the receiving partition rejected it?\r\n- Why write `COMMAND_REJECTION`s for internal commands not sent by a user anyway? Especially since the rejection is already described with a `MESSAGE_SUBSCRIPTION/REJECT` command.\r\n- To fully fix this, we need to find a way to recover from this broken state, not just prevent it from happening again.\r\n\r\nrelates to https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-19189\n\n oleschoenburg: Actually a duplicate of https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/5750 (thanks to @saig0 for finding it!) but let's keep this one open because it contains some more information on how a partition can get into this state\n remcowesterhoud: ZPA Triage:\r\n- As there is already a PR open for this I've put it in our iteration and in review so it's visible.\r\n- The PR is in draft, I've asked @oleschoenburg for clarification on the status of the PR.",

This helps offload time-consuming work that could otherwise block the actual workflow processing. \r\n\r\nFor example, job deadlines are checked for expiration by the `JobTimeoutTrigger`, which will append commands for each job to time them out. The stream processor will then process this command asynchronously. Eventually, the job changes state to `TIMED_OUT` when the command is processed. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the `JobTimeoutTrigger` continues to check for expired job deadlines periodically. If the stream processor is blocked, it may happen that the `JobTimeoutTrigger` continues to append the same `Job:TIME_OUT` command. There is nothing that stops it from overloading the stream processor.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many of the scheduled tasks suffer from a similar problem.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\n\r\nScheduled tasks need to keep a cache of recently appended commands (or something similar) that can be used to avoid appending the same command multiple times.\r\n\r\nThis should be available in a generic way, so all scheduled tasks can easily add support for this.\r\n\r\n**Incident**\r\n\r\nFollow up issue from incident: [INC-274: Streamprocessor lagging behind](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8CPBThWtPUxEpmwcoxeb_9pn1eRB2CPpHPiwEVoa3Q/edit#heading=h.hyf892uforsw)\r\n\r\nSupport: \r\n- https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-18291\r\n- https://jira.camunda.com/browse/SUPPORT-18997 \r\n\n\n korthout: Marking this as high impact, as it is a recurring pain. Resolving this would lower the load on clusters experiencing problems where timers, buffered messages, or job timeouts play a role. This would help in the investigation as well as ease recovery.\n abbasadel: I'm increasing the priority of this issue/feature to 'upcoming' since there is a support case waiting for it. \r\nStill, it is highly unlikely to be able to work on this before 8.4. However, we will update the issue once we plan to work on it.\n megglos: ZDP-Planning:\r\n- pushing into the inbox of ZPA to get an update on this as it relates to #14003\n korthout: The ZPA-team discussed this issue again and now considers this a bug. Originally, I felt it was a feature, as we have never supported many timers triggering at once (i.e., there's always a limit somewhere). However, the team feels that outages should not occur from existing features, irrespective of how they are used. Add to this that we don't have documentation about some artibrary limit to the number of timers. Lastly, users feel that this is a bug, and so should we.\r\n\r\nAs a bug, it may be easier to prioritize and release a fix for this as we can backport and patch previous versions.\n dddpaul: @korthout Hi!\r\n\r\nIs there any updates for this bug? I would be nice to have a due date )\n korthout: Hi @dddpaul, the team plans to spend time on this in our current iteration. There's a chance that we can fit a solution in the upcoming patch releases, but we cannot promise this.\n\nWe'll need to consider different solutions. For example, the proposed cache reduces the load on the system in most cases but will not remove the problem completely. Alternatively, ideas like #12560 could help but come with other downsides. The developer(s) working on this issue should consider whether caching is enough or whether another solution might be more fitting. As this is not yet clear, it's possible that a solution will not be ready before the upcoming patch releases. However, we plan to spend time on this issue now.\n Zelldon: There was an L1 blocker again because of this https://jira.camunda.com/plugins/servlet/mobile#issue/SUPPORT-18997 \n\nHandled by @npepinpe \n npepinpe: Users are heavily impacted by this, so I would like to bump this to critical, with a focus on fixing timers. Timers are different from message correlation has they don't involve inter-partition communication, which may help narrow the scope of the fix for now (i.e. writes are guaranteed to succeed).\r\n\r\nThat said, I noticed some possible concurrency issues with the `DueDateTimerChecker`, which could lead to more timers than required being scheduled under high load.\r\n\r\nIf enabled, the `DueDateTimerChecker` runs in the asynchronous scheduler actor, separately from the stream processor.\r\n\r\nHowever, both actors will access the `DueDateTimerChecker`:\r\n\r\n`DueDateTimerChecker#scheduleTimer` is called from the engine/side-effects, i.e. processing actor. It then:\r\n\r\n- Accesses the following state: `shouldRescheduleChecker`, `checkerRunning`, `nextDueDate` (rw)\r\n- Checks if the checker is currently running. This is a non-volatile boolean check.\r\n- If it's not running, it schedules a task.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, scheduling is done on the async scheduler actor. This is the `TriggerEntitiesTask`. It:\r\n\r\n- Accesses the following state: `shouldRescheduleChecker`, `checkerRunning` (rw), `nextDueDate` (rw)\r\n\r\nIs this correct? If so we have non-volatile state being accessed by two different actors, and possibly some race conditions on when and if to schedule the next timer.\r\n\r\nMoving on the the possible solution. In order to keep it light of course, we'd need to to have a way to identify a timer trigger uniquely. Since every time instance can only be scheduled for trigger once in the state, it should be enough to distinguish them with the timer key, which is a single long. \r\n\r\nThe general idea, then, is to cache locally in the `DueDateTimerChecker` state (or some state) which commands have been written, so as to avoid writing them again. A perfect cache would be unbounded - you'd have to possibly store as many timers in there as could possibly exist (worst case scenario).  But a lossy cache is probably acceptable. Take `LongHashSet` from Agrona - an empty, pre-initialized set instance of 1 million keys takes 8MB of memory. Filled, it takes about twice, ~16MB. It's a bit hard to add LRU behavior to such a set however. Eviction could be random to keep things simple/fast, or we can use a `SortedSet`. However, a `TreeSet` takes about ~60MB for 1 million longs, so it's already substantially heavier - but it's pretty easy/fast to add LRU eviction to it. So on the off chance the key was evicted _before_ it was removed explicitly from the cache, you'd potentially still write a second trigger command. But the bigger the cache, the less likely this is to happen.\r\n\r\nI sync'd with @Zelldon today about this, and we decided to move forward with the local cache, only for checkers which perform no inter-partition communication.\r\n\r\nFor timers, we'll use the timer key as the unique cache ID. When iterating of timers, if the timer key is in the cache, then we skip it. Once the task result is built, we can populate the cache with all the timer keys we will be writing. Since the scheduler (even async) is sequenced, we're guaranteed that this write will succeed, or the whole thing will fail (and the cache would be \"restarted\"). We won't be touching things like leader election and so on. On recovery, it's still possible that the same timers would be triggered twice, but the overload load will be greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThis solution is likely adaptable to other checkers which run locally, such as job timeout and message expiry. For messages we can easily use the key. For jobs, we can't use the job key, since you can have multiple activations/time outs. We could use the job key if we can guarantee that the cache is properly cleaned up whenever the job is activated.\r\n\r\nAnyway, long winded comment to say we'll get started on a bounded lossy cache-based prototype.\r\n\r\n\n npepinpe: So in the end, we'll build the cache on the stream processor side. I describe the approach we ended up with in the description of this PR: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15073\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions. For now it's entirely on the stream platform/ZDP side, but it's still useful to know how it works. Plus, if you want to cache future scheduled commands in the future, you'll need to know where to add them :upside_down_face: \n npepinpe: See some benchmark results courtesy of @Zelldon - https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/15073#issuecomment-1803887603 :tada: \n korthout: We took it off the ZPA board, as ZDP has found a solution on their side 🙇  Thanks again @Zelldon and @npepinpe \n dddpaul: Hi!\r\n\r\nThis looks like a wonderful job.  But this new timer cache doesn't solve my problem with bunch of UNIQUE timers from DIFFERENT process instances. I've illustrated my problem here https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/5134#issuecomment-1752006281. My comment was stated as duplicate of this issue which was likely fixed with timer cache solution in PR #15136 (for 8.3).\r\n\r\nI could not understand how this cache solution will help me but had some hope and belief.

It is frustrating to find that issue, especially if an user has no access to the logs. \r\n\r\nThis is also more problematic if this values is later only consumes by some jobs and cause more issues, and is not visible as incident.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nCreate process model with an invalid feel expression.\r\n<!--\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\nIf possible add a minimal reproducer code sample\r\n- when using the Java client: https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-test-template-java\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWe create incidents for failed feel expression evaluation with a clear message, similar to the log message.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n- Zeebe Version: 1.3.5<!-- [e.g. 0.20.0] -->\r\n- Configuration: <!-- [e.g. exporters etc.] -->\r\n\n\n Zelldon: This caused for example also this https://camunda.slack.com/archives/C034N0E5YCX/p1647857272889399\n Zelldon: Probably duplicate of https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/issues/5880 but tbh it is just annoying and I wanted to express my feeling here :sweat_smile: The other also still awaits stakeholder input, would be good to get this.\n saig0: Related feature request in the FEEL engine: https://github.com/camunda/feel-scala/issues/260\n saig0: With the new version of the FEEL engine (1.17.0), we could improve the UX. The new API doesn't return only the evaluation result but also potential warnings. We could append these warnings in the incident message to help the user to solve the problem. \r\n\r\nFor example, instead of creating an incident with the message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExpected result of the expression 'date an time (\"2022-03-21T11:15:00@Europe/Berlin\") - now()' to be one of '[DURATION, PERIOD, STRING]', but was 'NULL'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could create an incident with the following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExpected result of the expression 'date an time (\"2022-03-21T11:15:00@Europe/Berlin\") - now()' to be one of '[DURATION, PERIOD, STRING]', but was 'NULL'. \r\nThe evaluation reported the following warnings:  [NO_FUNCTION_FOUND] No function found with name 'date an time' and 1 parameters; [INVALID_TYPE] Can't subtract '2023-09-25T12:00:43.591630872@Etc/UTC' from 'null'\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc: @aleksander-dytko ",

    "gitHubText": "**Description**\r\n\r\nSpring already comes with the concept of sanitizing the environment to hide sensitive data, configured via custom `SanitizingFunction` implementations. These will sanitize all properties visible in the `/env` and `/configprops` actuators. These only show us the user provided configuration, though.\r\n\r\nFrom the `/configprops` endpoint, you can then see all the beans with `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation. Each shows the configuration prefix (e.g. `zeebe.broker`), the resolved properties, and the input properties. Input properties will also show the source of the property (e.g. environment, system property, configuration file, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhat's the advantage over logging the config?\r\n\r\n1. Security - while we sanitize the config output, it's very basic, and putting it behind a management endpoint allows users to configure the security to access such things.\r\n2. In many cases, looking up the config requires scrolling to the logs to find where it was. Having it readily accessible via an endpoint is very useful - we can ask users to just curl and send us the output.\r\n3. Often, we don't really care to look at the config, so it's just additional logging noise\r\n4. It would cut down on the Spring dependencies incurred via the `ObjectWriterFactory` by just moving it all into actuators.\r\n\n\n npepinpe: Here's a sample PR of what it would look like: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/14402\r\n\r\nI had it in the \"chamber\" so to speak before opening the issue, since I wanted to make sure this was actually do-able :smile: \n npepinpe: For testing, I added `clusterName` to the list of sanitized keys (via `management.sanitize.keywords` property):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/assets/43373/f3a36aee-be4e-4282-b712-af9e534c8225)\r\n\n npepinpe: As I'm off for FTO, if anyone wants to take it over from the existing PR, go for it.

    "gitHubText": "Leaders track the configuration index of all members in the replication group so that it can send a configuration update to outdated members. Previously, the leader only updated the configuration index when receiving a successful configuration response. In cases where a leader initially accepted the current configuration but then loses it again, for example because of dataloss or because it never managed to commit the configuration, the leaders view of the members configuration index remained outdated: The leader thought member B had configuration index X but actually the member has no configuration at all. This could only be resolved by restarting the leader or when creating a new configuration.\r\n\r\nAs a fix, the append response now contains the configuration index. The leader updates the configuration index when it receives an append response. This allows followers to signal to the leader that they have no configuration at all or and outdated one. Before the leader tries to send the next append request, it will first send a configuration request and bring the follower up to date.\r\n\r\nOn the follower side, we now reject append requests if there is not current configuration. The append response has configuration index -1, guaranteeing that the leader will send a configure request next.\r\n\r\n### Backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nAdding a new field to the `AppendResponse` is safe, we have done it before: https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/pull/14063#discussion_r1311219403\r\n\r\nFollowers from the previous version do not send a configuration index. A leader from the new version will then read a 0 (default value for longs). To prevent that the follower from the previous version is then stuck in a configuration loop, we treat configuration index 0 as a special case and _don't_ update the configuration index. Effectively, we fall back to the old behavior where the configuration index is only updated when a configuration response is sent. This fallback is safe for us because we want to fix a _join_ bug where it's guaranteed that the configuration index is not 0.\r\n\r\nCloses #15381",

    "gitHubText": "## Description\r\n\r\nWhen SessionService is constructed, the postConstruct method starts a scheduled deletion of expired session ids. This eventually calls one of the two SessionRepository beans, which makes a static method call to DatabaseInfo.getCurrent(). This is all done during bean creation, and the call to DatabaseInfo is static, so there is no guarantee that the DatabaseInfo bean has been created and the applicationContext set. It is therefore possible to cause a NPE in getCurrent(), which assumed applicationContext had already been set. Adding a guard would eliminate the NPE, but could potentially report the wrong database type when opensearch is used (since Elasticsearch is the default return value). The real solution is to fix the bean creation order so DatabaseInfo is fully instantiated before any implementations of AbstractIndexDescriptor.\r\n\r\n- Added a NPE guard in DatabaseInfo.isCurrent()\r\n- Added a log to output if this function is called before applicationContext has been set\r\n- Added a dependency (through Autowired) in AbstractIndexDescriptor which will force spring to create DatabaseInfo completely before any of the components that extend AbstractIndexDescriptor\r\n\r\nIt is possible this may have to be done in other places, for now this will prevent the NPE and alert us if this happens elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Which issues are closed by this PR or are related -->\r\n\r\ncloses #\r\n\r\n<!-- Cut-off marker\r\n_All lines under and including the cut-off marker will be removed from the merge commit message_\r\n\r\n## Definition of Ready\r\n\r\nPlease check the items that apply, before requesting a review.\r\n\r\nYou can find more details in our [wiki page] (https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/wiki/Pull-Requests-and-Code-Reviews).\r\n\r\n* [ ] I've reviewed my own code\r\n* [x] I've written a clear changelist description\r\n* [x] I've narrowly scoped my changes\r\n* [ ] I've separated structural from behavioural changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Definition of Done\r\n\r\n<!-- As author please check the items that apply before requesting a review. -->\r\n\r\n_Not all items need to be done depending on the issue and the pull request._\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n* [ ] All acceptance criteria described in the issue are met\r\n* [ ] The changes are backwards compatibility with previous versions\r\n* [ ] If it fixes a bug then PRs are created to backport (https://github.com/korthout/backport-action#how-it-works) the fix to the last two minor versions.

I see 2 options here - we can merge a \"copied\" version without a fix in one commit and then a fix in a separate one. Otherwise - yes we can just mark it with a comment in the code. Which one would you prefer?\n matt-whiteman: I think you can avoid having to changing the bean type within all the clients and operations objects since ExtendedOpenSearchClient extends OpenSearchClient. You would just need to update the **fixedSearch** function in OpenSearchDocumentOperations to look like:\r\n\r\n\r\n>  public <R> SearchResponse<R> fixedSearch(SearchRequest request, Class<R> classR) {\r\n>    if (openSearchClient instanceof ExtendedOpenSearchClient) {\r\n>        return safe(() -> (ExtendedOpenSearchClient)openSearchClient.fixedSearch(request, classR), e -> defaultDeleteErrorMessage(request.index().toString()));\r\n>        }\r\n>        else {\r\n>           return search(request, classR);\r\n>        }\r\n>   }\r\n\r\n  \r\n  The benefit of this would be that if the fix ever gets put into the OpenSearch client and we want to remove ExtendedOpenSearchCLient, it's in much fewer places.\n oleksandr-kriuchenko-lohika: > I think you can avoid having to changing the bean type within all the clients and operations objects since ExtendedOpenSearchClient extends OpenSearchClient.

The idea is that it might be accumulating all the necessary fixes and that is the whole purpose of it and the only reason for its existance. But I would gladly listen to alternatives.",

Campaign parameters will now be stored as super properties persistently in all versions.\n\n### [`v2.48.0`](https://togithub.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/releases/tag/v2.48.0): Configurable API endpoints, miscellaneous updates and fixes\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/compare/v2.47.0...v2.48.0)\n\nAPI endpoint routes can now be configured individually, so you can rename /track, /engage, and /groups HTTP endpoints arbitrarily. Configure with the `api_routes` option:\n\n```js\nmixpanel.init(`my token`, {\n  api_host: `https://my-proxy.example.com`,\n  api_routes: {\n    track: `foo/`,\n    engage: `bar/`,\n    groups: `baz/`,\n  },\n));\n```\n\nIn the above example, event-tracking requests will go to `https://my-proxy.example.com/foo/`, user profile updates to `https://my-proxy.example.com/bar/`, etc.\n\nOther fixes:\n\n-   Event properties object passed to `mixpanel.track()` will no longer be mutated\n-   Super properties are now reloaded from persistence when making every tracking call (i.e., kept fresh when another tab/window in the same browser has updated them)\n-   Extra failsafe behavior for trying to clear queued requests when localStorage doesn't work on startup, e.g., when localStorage is full so writes fail\n-   Block Chrome-Lighthouse user agent\n-   Fix for error in `add_group()` when adding a new group to an existing list\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config. Please merge this manually once you are satisfied.\n\n♻ **Rebasing**: Whenever PR is behind base branch, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n🔕 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR has been generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).

See [#&#8203;332](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/332) for more details.\n\n### [`v8.3.0`](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#830)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/compare/8.2.5...8.3.0)\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n*Changes in APIs or behaviour that may affect existing applications that use zeebe-node.*\n\n-   Several method signatures for `CreateProcessInstance` and `CreateProcessInstanceWithResult` have been removed, leaving only the method that takes an object parameter. See [#&#8203;330](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/330#issuecomment-1672535320) for more details.\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n*Things that don't work or don't work as expected, and which will be addressed in a future release*\n\n-   The `onConnectionError` event fires correctly for Camunda SaaS, but fires a false positive when connecting to a Self-Managed instance. See [#&#8203;340](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/340) for more details.\n\n#### New Features\n\n*New shiny stuff.*\n\n-   Camunda Platform 8.3.0 introduces multi-tenancy. To support this, the Node.js client adds an optional `tenantId` parameter to `DeployResource`, `DeployProcess`, `CreateProcessInstance`, `CreateProcessInstanceWithResult`, and `PublishMessage`. You can also specify a `tenantId` in the ZBClient constructor or via the environment variable `ZEEBE_TENANT_ID`. In the case that you specify it via the environment or constructor, it will be transparently added to all method invocations. See [#&#8203;330](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/330) for more details.\n-   `@grpc/grpc-js` has been updated to 1.9.7, and `@grpc/proto-loader` has been updated to 0.7.10.\n\n*Things that were broken and are now fixed.*\n\n-   The `onReady` and `onConnection` event tests now pass, so these events should be usable. See [#&#8203;215](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/215) for more details.\n\n#### Fixes\n\n*Things that were broken and are now fixed.*\n\n-   An error message \"Grpc Stream Error: 16 UNAUTHENTICATED: Failed to parse bearer token, see cause for details\" would be logged intermittently. This was because under particular conditions an expired token cached on disk could be used for API calls. To prevent this, the disk-cached token is evicted at the same time as the in-memory token. See [#&#8203;336](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/336) for more details.\n-   The `onReady` and `onConnection` event tests now pass for Camunda SaaS. The `onReady` event fires correctly for Self-Managed started with docker-compose. See [#&#8203;215](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/215) and [#&#8203;340](https://togithub.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-client-node-js/issues/340) for more details.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

I already posted this question in [ask-zeebe](https://camunda.slack.com/archives/CSQ2E3BT4/p1698768046424059). Unfortunately, on process def deletion, we will not receive any Task delete events as the tasks are removed from runtime state as soon they are completed or terminated. Meaning they already don't exist in Zeebe when the process definition is deleted from Zeebe. So we will receive only one event (or to be more precise, one event per zeebe partition) about process definition deletion and nothing else.\n esraagamal6: @houssain-barouni Can you please review the test cases taking into consideration that it would be executed for both ES and OS?\n houssain-barouni: > @houssain-barouni Can you please review the test cases taking into consideration that it would be executed for both ES and OS?\r\n\r\nI don't have access to TestRail, I opened a ticket to Helpdesk.

One hour is the time required for a completed task to be archived. The archived task should be deleted as well.\n esraagamal6: Testing updates:\r\n\r\n- Completed tasks are removed from Tasklist completed panel when it is deleted via `zbctl delete resoource` but when it is deleted from Operate UI the completed tasks remains in the completed tasks panel in Tasklist -> @houssain-barouni  is investigating this\r\n- **Some** processes could be deleted via `zbctl delete resoource`  although it has running instances and in this case those running instances remains in Tasklist but the task details data is never retrieved in Tasklist UI `\r\n404 Not Found` , but this should not be a blocker because this should be handled in Zeebe team in this [ticket](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15221)\n houssain-barouni: > Testing updates:\r\n> \r\n> * Completed tasks are removed from Tasklist completed panel when it is deleted via `zbctl delete resoource` but when it is deleted from Operate UI the completed tasks remains in the completed tasks panel in Tasklist -> @houssain-barouni  is investigating this\r\n> * **Some** processes could be deleted via `zbctl delete resoource`  although it has running instances and in this case those running instances remains in Tasklist but the task details data is never retrieved in Tasklist UI ` 404 Not Found` , but this should not be a blocker because this should be handled in Zeebe team in this [ticket](https://github.com/camunda/zeebe/issues/15221)\r\n\r\n@esraagamal6 \r\nI have reproduced the issue:\r\n- Zeebe is configured with 2 partitions\r\n- Some tasks are created on partition 1 , others on partition 2 (depends where the process instance is started)\r\n- When the process is deleted , Zeebe notifies tasklist with partitionId=1 (It is expected to receive notifications for all partitions about process deletion)\r\n- We delete only tasks on partition 1\r\n\r\nI will check with Zeebe team, why notification is sent only for one partition\r\n\r\n**Update:** Actually we are receiving the event for both partitions, I will check why the partition 2 event was skipped\r\n\r\n**Update 2:** I confirm that for PROCESS records we handle the events for one single partition https://github.com/camunda/tasklist/blob/89f0ea75f7835485ffae79184cf34e5d2c3a5ccf/importer/src/main/java/io/camunda/tasklist/zeebeimport/RecordsReaderHolder.java#L54-L55\r\nI will remove the filtering on `partitionId` for the deletion\n esraagamal6: Testing updates:\r\nWhen process  has more than 10 instances to be deleted some of them are displayed in tasklist after deletion on openSearch\n houssain-barouni: > Testing updates: When process has more than 10 instances to be deleted some of them are displayed in tasklist after deletion on openSearch\r\n\r\n@esraagamal6 \r\nScrolling in Opensearch was broken (it affects also master), we were fetching only 10 first results only. I have fixed it.\r\nExample of usecase affected by broken opensearch scrolling in master:\r\n- Create 11 tasks having a variable varA=foo\r\n- Do a search task query with varA=foo\r\n- You will notice that only 10 tasks are returned instead of 11\n esraagamal6: @houssain-barouni Tested OK",

This comment has been updated with latest results.\n marcosgvieira: @nathansandi Is this still a draft or is it ready to review?\n nathansandi: Hi @marcosgvieira I just moved to review\r\n\r\nIt was a draft, in the time I open because I was trying to reproduce the error (but could not for tasks), but at the same time I think its a gain to put this in PROD to prevent bugs related to nullable fields on  JSON. \n marcosgvieira: @nathansandi, just for my understanding what happens when the `return objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);` against the \"null\" value that causes the error?\n nathansandi: > @nathansandi, just for my understanding what happens when the `return objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);` against the \"null\" value that causes the error?\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar to Start Process by a form (PS: Maybe this was already threaten over forms for Tasks), when calling objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);, Jackson (the underlying library used by objectMapper) attempts to deserialize the JSON string in variable.getValue() into a Java object of type Object. The problem arises when the JSON string represents the literal string \"null\" rather than the JSON null value.\r\n\r\nIn JSON, the value null is a special keyword indicating the absence of a value or a null value. It's not represented as a string, but as the literal null. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"someKey\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn contrast, if you have a string \"null\" in your JSON, it is treated as a regular string and not a null value:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"someKey\": \"null\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, when you attempt to deserialize the string \"null\" into an Object using objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);, Jackson tries to parse it as a regular string, not as the special null value, resulting in the actual string \"null\" being returned.\r\n\r\nTo handle this situation, I've added a check:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (variable.getValue().equals(\"null\")) {\r\n  return \"null\"; // JSON Object null must be instanced like \"null\", also should not send to\r\n  // objectMapper null values\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis check ensures that if the variable.getValue() is the string \"null,\" you return the string \"null\" instead of trying to deserialize it using Jackson. This way, you're preserving the original intent of the \"null\" string in your JSON data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n marcosgvieira: > So, when you attempt to deserialize the string \"null\" into an Object using objectMapper.readValue(variable.getValue(), Object.class);, Jackson tries to parse it as a regular string, not as the special null value, resulting in the actual string \"null\" being returned.\r\n\r\nSo isn't it the same result as the new condition we are adding?\n nathansandi: > So isn't it the same result as the new condition we are adding?\r\n\r\nYes, In such a case, you explicitly return the string \"null\" without attempting to deserialize it using objectMapper.\r\nThe problem would be if go to Object mapper with the \"null\" value \r\n\r\nThis code is handling both the case where the input is the string \"null\" and the case where it's a valid JSON string. The added condition ensures that you handle the special case of the string \"null\" without attempting unnecessary deserialization. The error was caused when goes to Object Mapper, trying to serialize the null json value\r\n\n marcosgvieira: > e the input is the string \"null\" and the case where it's a valid JSON string. The added condition ensures that you handle the special case of the string \"null\" without attempting unnecessary deserialization. The error was caused when goes to Object Mapper, trying to serialize the null json value\r\n\r\nThen if the result is the same I don't think we are fixing any error as the behavior is the same (also we are adding a condition to all the cases to try to avoid a deserialization in a case that doesn't happen so often) - should we really add this condition? The #3585 also cannot be closed by this PR as it's covered in another task by @houssain-barouni can you check if you referenced the right ticket?\n marcosgvieira: After a chat with @nathansandi he explained that when passing \"null\" to the objectMapper a NullPointer is throwed, so this is the reason for the condition.\n github-actions[bot]: Successfully created backport PR for `stable/8.3`:\n- #3810\n github-actions[bot]: Successfully created backport PR for `stable/8.2`:\n- #3811",

type { Plugin } from 'vite'\nimport type { ViteReactPluginApi } from '@&#8203;vitejs/plugin-react'\n\nexport const somePlugin: Plugin = {\n  name: 'some-plugin',\n  api: {\n    reactBabel:

Here we are mainly making sure that the interaction between components is working:\r\n- deploying a process in Zeebe for a tenant requires an authenticated gRPC call\r\n- Importers are getting the objects with their tenants and storing the tenantId in DB (Test checkers are using a \"Tenant Aware\" context to verify if the deployment was propagated to Tasklist)\r\n- Tasklist should take into account the tenants being set in the context to allow/filter/disallow some actions on tenant aware objects\r\n\r\n## Definition of Done\r\n\r\n<!-- As author please check the items that apply before requesting a review. -->\r\n\r\n_Not all items need to be done depending on the issue and the pull request._\r\n\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria described in the issue are met\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Unit/integration tests are written, that verify all acceptance criteria of the issue\r\n- [ ] E2E tests are written, if the acceptance criteria can't be covered in unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] The fix/feature is tested manually by the author\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n\r\n- [ ] If documentation needs to be updated, an issue is created in the [camunda-platform-docs](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs) repo, and the issue is added to our Operate/Tasklist project board.\r\n\r\n## Definition of Reviewed\r\n\r\n<!-- As a reviewer please check the items that apply before approving this PR -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria described in the issue are met\r\n- [ ] Unit/integration tests are written, that verify all acceptance criteria of the issue\r\n- [ ] E2E tests are written, if the acceptance criteria can't be covered in unit/integration tests\r\n- [ ] The fix/feature is tested manually by the reviewer\r\n\n\n github-actions[bot]: ## Test Results\n  97 files  +  95    97 suites  +95   1h 34m 25s [:stopwatch:](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action/blob/v2.11.0/README.md#the-symbols \"duration of all tests\") + 1h 29m 38s\n484 tests +479  474 [:heavy_check_mark:](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action/blob/v2.11.0/README.md#the-symbols \"passed tests\") +469  10 [:zzz:](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action/blob/v2.11.0/README.md#the-symbols \"skipped / disabled tests\") +10  0 [:x:](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action/blob/v2.11.0/README.md#the-symbols \"failed tests\") ±0 \n506 runs  +501  496 [:heavy_check_mark:](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action/blob/v2.11.0/README.md#the-symbols \"passed tests\") +491  10 [:zzz:](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action/blob/v2.11.0/README.md#the-symbols \"skipped / disabled tests\") +10  0 [:x:](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action/blob/v2.11.0/README.md#the-symbols \"failed tests\") ±0 \n\nResults for commit 9e41af43. ± Comparison against base commit a813d001.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>This pull request <b>removes</b> 5 and <b>adds</b> 484 tests. <i>Note that renamed tests count towards both.</i></summary>\n\n```\nio.camunda.tasklist.qa.migration.BasicProcessTest ‑ testImportPositions\nio.camunda.tasklist.qa.migration.BasicProcessTest ‑ testTasks\nio.camunda.tasklist.qa.migration.BasicProcessTest ‑ testUsers\nio.camunda.tasklist.qa.migration.BigVariableProcessTest ‑ testTasks\nio.camunda.tasklist.qa.migration.BigVariableProcessTest ‑ testVariables\n```\n\n```\nio.camunda.tasklist.ProbesTestElasticSearchIT ‑ testIsNotReady\nio.camunda.tasklist.ProbesTestElasticSearchIT ‑ testIsReady\nio.camunda.tasklist.ProbesTestOpenSearchIT ‑ Unknown test\nio.camunda.tasklist.StartupIT ‑ Unknown test\nio.camunda.tasklist.config.GenerateOpenApiIT ‑ testSwaggerUIIsLoaded\nio.camunda.tasklist.data.conditionals.DataBaseConditionTest ‑ matches(DataBaseCondition, String, boolean)[10]\nio.camunda.tasklist.data.conditionals.DataBaseConditionTest ‑ matches(DataBaseCondition, String, boolean)[1]\nio.camunda.tasklist.data.conditionals.DataBaseConditionTest ‑ matches(DataBaseCondition, String, boolean)[2]\nio.camunda.tasklist.data.conditionals.DataBaseConditionTest ‑ matches(DataBaseCondition, String, boolean)[3]\nio.camunda.tasklist.data.conditionals.DataBaseConditionTest ‑ matches(DataBaseCondition, String, boolean)[4]\n…\n```\n</details>\n\n[test-results]:data:application/gzip;base64,H4sIAHUHbWUC/03MSw7CIBSF4a00jB2A8nQz5grchNgWQ2Fk3LvQ1MLw/05yPgTD7Ddyn4y6TGQrIfdyJUEOca0tpBRV6pjbzDX/12Mr1jZSA73CuxKjpyCEuUoHn1JMh6SytlNB5RHnp+kyXO4wPO49Htq4LCHXIMZzBshvV6VQKq/RUgT5tBocOMe0FhaYEoZ8fxwuaMEKAQAA\n\n:recycle: This comment has been updated with latest results.\n marcosgvieira: @houssain-barouni is this ready to review or should we wait?\n houssain-barouni: > @houssain-barouni is this ready to review or should we wait?\r\n\r\nyes @marcosgvieira this is ready to be reviewed\r\nThere is a glitchy test in ci-os suite (sometimes it fails, sometimes it passes).

Configure with the `api_routes` option:\n\n```js\nmixpanel.init(`my token`, {\n  api_host: `https://my-proxy.example.com`,\n  api_routes: {\n    track: `foo/`,\n    engage: `bar/`,\n    groups: `baz/`,\n  },\n));\n```\n\nIn the above example, event-tracking requests will go to `https://my-proxy.example.com/foo/`, user profile updates to `https://my-proxy.example.com/bar/`, etc.\n\nOther fixes:\n\n-   Event properties object passed to `mixpanel.track()` will no longer be mutated\n-   Super properties are now reloaded from persistence when making every tracking call (i.e., kept fresh when another tab/window in the same browser has updated them)\n-   Extra failsafe behavior for trying to clear queued requests when localStorage doesn't work on startup, e.g., when localStorage is full so writes fail\n-   Block Chrome-Lighthouse user agent\n-   Fix for error in `add_group()` when adding a new group to an existing list\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
